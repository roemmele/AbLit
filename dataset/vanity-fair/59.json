        "text": "The Major's visit left old John Sedley in a great state of agitation and excitement. His daughter could not induce him to settle down to his customary occupations or amusements that night. He passed the evening fumbling amongst his boxes and desks, untying his papers with trembling hands, and sorting and arranging them against Jos's arrival. He had them in the greatest order--his tapes and his files, his receipts, and his letters with lawyers and correspondents; the documents relative to the wine project (which failed from a most unaccountable accident, after commencing with the most splendid prospects), the coal project (which only a want of capital prevented from becoming the most successful scheme ever put before the public), the patent saw-mills and sawdust consolidation project, &c., &c. All night, until a very late hour, he passed in the preparation of these documents, trembling about from one room to another, with a quivering candle and shaky hands. Here's the wine papers, here's the sawdust, here's the coals; here's my letters to Calcutta and Madras, and replies from Major Dobbin, C.B., and Mr. Joseph Sedley to the same. \"He shall find no irregularity about ME, Emmy,\" the old gentleman said.\nEmmy smiled. \"I don't think Jos will care about seeing those papers, Papa,\" she said.\n\"You don't know anything about business, my dear,\" answered the sire, shaking his head with an important air. And it must be confessed that on this point Emmy was very ignorant, and that is a pity some people are so knowing. All these twopenny documents arranged on a side table, old Sedley covered them carefully over with a clean bandanna handkerchief (one out of Major Dobbin's lot) and enjoined the maid and landlady of the house, in the most solemn way, not to disturb those papers, which were arranged for the arrival of Mr. Joseph Sedley the next morning, \"Mr. Joseph Sedley of the Honourable East India Company's Bengal Civil Service.\"\nAmelia found him up very early the next morning, more eager, more hectic, and more shaky than ever. \"I didn't sleep much, Emmy, my dear,\" he said. \"I was thinking of my poor Bessy. I wish she was alive, to ride in Jos's carriage once again. She kept her own and became it very well.\" And his eyes filled with tears, which trickled down his furrowed old face. Amelia wiped them away, and smilingly kissed him, and tied the old man's neckcloth in a smart bow, and put his brooch into his best shirt frill, in which, in his Sunday suit of mourning, he sat from six o'clock in the morning awaiting the arrival of his son.\nHowever, when the postman made his appearance, the little party were put out of suspense by the receipt of a letter from Jos to his sister, who announced that he felt a little fatigued after his voyage, and should not be able to move on that day, but that he would leave Southampton early the next morning and be with his father and mother at evening. Amelia, as she read out the letter to her father, paused over the latter word; her brother, it was clear, did not know what had happened in the family. Nor could he, for the fact is that, though the Major rightly suspected that his travelling companion never would be got into motion in so short a space as twenty-four hours, and would find some excuse for delaying, yet Dobbin had not written to Jos to inform him of the calamity which had befallen the Sedley family, being occupied in talking with Amelia until long after post-hour.\nThere are some splendid tailors' shops in the High Street of Southampton, in the fine plate-glass windows of which hang gorgeous waistcoats of all sorts, of silk and velvet, and gold and crimson, and pictures of the last new fashions, in which those wonderful gentlemen with quizzing glasses, and holding on to little boys with the exceeding large eyes and curly hair, ogle ladies in riding habits prancing by the Statue of Achilles at Apsley House. Jos, although provided with some of the most splendid vests that Calcutta could furnish, thought he could not go to town until he was supplied with one or two of these garments, and selected a crimson satin, embroidered with gold butterflies, and a black and red velvet tartan with white stripes and a rolling collar, with which, and a rich blue satin stock and a gold pin, consisting of a five-barred gate with a horseman in pink enamel jumping over it, he thought he might make his entry into London with some dignity. For Jos's former shyness and blundering blushing timidity had given way to a more candid and courageous self-assertion of his worth. \"I don't care about owning it,\" Waterloo Sedley would say to his friends, \"I am a dressy man\"; and though rather uneasy if the ladies looked at him at the Government House balls, and though he blushed and turned away alarmed under their glances, it was chiefly from a dread lest they should make love to him that he avoided them, being averse to marriage altogether. But there was no such swell in Calcutta as Waterloo Sedley, I have heard say, and he had the handsomest turn-out, gave the best bachelor dinners, and had the finest plate in the whole place.\nTo make these waistcoats for a man of his size and dignity took at least a day, part of which he employed in hiring a servant to wait upon him and his native and in instructing the agent who cleared his baggage, his boxes, his books, which he never read, his chests of mangoes, chutney, and curry-powders, his shawls for presents to people whom he didn't know as yet, and the rest of his Persicos apparatus.\nAt length, he drove leisurely to London on the third day and in the new waistcoat, the native, with chattering teeth, shuddering in a shawl on the box by the side of the new European servant; Jos puffing his pipe at intervals within and looking so majestic that the little boys cried Hooray, and many people thought he must be a Governor-General. HE, I promise, did not decline the obsequious invitation of the landlords to alight and refresh himself in the neat country towns. Having partaken of a copious breakfast, with fish, and rice, and hard eggs, at Southampton, he had so far rallied at Winchester as to think a glass of sherry necessary. At Alton he stepped out of the carriage at his servant's request and imbibed some of the ale for which the place is famous. At Farnham he stopped to view the Bishop's Castle and to partake of a light dinner of stewed eels, veal cutlets, and French beans, with a bottle of claret. He was cold over Bagshot Heath, where the native chattered more and more, and Jos Sahib took some brandy-and-water; in fact, when he drove into town he was as full of wine, beer, meat, pickles, cherry-brandy, and tobacco as the steward's cabin of a steam-packet. It was evening when his carriage thundered up to the little door in Brompton, whither the affectionate fellow drove first, and before hieing to the apartments secured for him by Mr. Dobbin at the Slaughters'.\nAll the faces in the street were in the windows; the little maidservant flew to the wicket-gate; the Mesdames Clapp looked out from the casement of the ornamented kitchen; Emmy, in a great flutter, was in the passage among the hats and coats; and old Sedley in the parlour inside, shaking all over. Jos descended from the post-chaise and down the creaking swaying steps in awful state, supported by the new valet from Southampton and the shuddering native, whose brown face was now livid with cold and of the colour of a turkey's gizzard. He created an immense sensation in the passage presently, where Mrs. and Miss Clapp, coming perhaps to listen at the parlour door, found Loll Jewab shaking upon the hall-bench under the coats, moaning in a strange piteous way, and showing his yellow eyeballs and white teeth.\nFor, you see, we have adroitly shut the door upon the meeting between Jos and the old father and the poor little gentle sister inside. The old man was very much affected; so, of course, was his daughter; nor was Jos without feeling. In that long absence of ten years, the most selfish will think about home and early ties. Distance sanctifies both. Long brooding over those lost pleasures exaggerates their charm and sweetness. Jos was unaffectedly glad to see and shake the hand of his father, between whom and himself there had been a coolness--glad to see his little sister, whom he remembered so pretty and smiling, and pained at the alteration which time, grief, and misfortune had made in the shattered old man. Emmy had come out to the door in her black clothes and whispered to him of her mother's death, and not to speak of it to their father. There was no need of this caution, for the elder Sedley himself began immediately to speak of the event, and prattled about it, and wept over it plenteously. It shocked the Indian not a little and made him think of himself less than the poor fellow was accustomed to do.\nThe result of the interview must have been very satisfactory, for when Jos had reascended his post-chaise and had driven away to his hotel, Emmy embraced her father tenderly, appealing to him with an air of triumph, and asking the old man whether she did not always say that her brother had a good heart?\nIndeed, Joseph Sedley, affected by the humble position in which he found his relations, and in the expansiveness and overflowing of heart occasioned by the first meeting, declared that they should never suffer want or discomfort any more, that he was at home for some time at any rate, during which his house and everything he had should be theirs: and that Amelia would look very pretty at the head of his table--until she would accept one of her own.\nShe shook her head sadly and had, as usual, recourse to the waterworks. She knew what he meant. She and her young confidante, Miss Mary, had talked over the matter most fully, the very night of the Major's visit, beyond which time the impetuous Polly could not refrain from talking of the discovery which she had made, and describing the start and tremor of joy by which Major Dobbin betrayed himself when Mr. Binny passed with his bride and the Major learned that he had no longer a rival to fear. \"Didn't you see how he shook all over when you asked if he was married and he said, 'Who told you those lies?' Oh, M'am,\" Polly said, \"he never kept his eyes off you, and I'm sure he's grown grey athinking of you.\"\nBut Amelia, looking up at her bed, over which hung the portraits of her husband and son, told her young protegee never, never, to speak on that subject again; that Major Dobbin had been her husband's dearest friend and her own and George's most kind and affectionate guardian; that she loved him as a brother--but that a woman who had been married to such an angel as that, and she pointed to the wall, could never think of any other union. Poor Polly sighed: she thought what she should do if young Mr. Tomkins, at the surgery, who always looked at her so at church, and who, by those mere aggressive glances had put her timorous little heart into such a flutter that she was ready to surrender at once,--what she should do if he were to die? She knew he was consumptive, his cheeks were so red and he was so uncommon thin in the waist.\nNot that Emmy, being made aware of the honest Major's passion, rebuffed him in any way, or felt displeased with him. Such an attachment from so true and loyal a gentleman could make no woman angry. Desdemona was not angry with Cassio, though there is very little doubt she saw the Lieutenant's partiality for her (and I for my part believe that many more things took place in that sad affair than the worthy Moorish officer ever knew of); why, Miranda was even very kind to Caliban, and we may be pretty sure for the same reason. Not that she would encourage him in the least--the poor uncouth monster--of course not. No more would Emmy by any means encourage her admirer, the Major. She would give him that friendly regard, which so much excellence and fidelity merited; she would treat him with perfect cordiality and frankness until he made his proposals, and THEN it would be time enough for her to speak and to put an end to hopes which never could be realized.\nShe slept, therefore, very soundly that evening, after the conversation with Miss Polly, and was more than ordinarily happy, in spite of Jos's delaying. \"I am glad he is not going to marry that Miss O'Dowd,\" she thought. \"Colonel O'Dowd never could have a sister fit for such an accomplished man as Major William.\" Who was there amongst her little circle who would make him a good wife? Not Miss Binny, she was too old and ill-tempered; Miss Osborne? too old too. Little Polly was too young. Mrs. Osborne could not find anybody to suit the Major before she went to sleep.\nThe same morning brought Major Dobbin a letter to the Slaughters' Coffee-house from his friend at Southampton, begging dear Dob to excuse Jos for being in a rage when awakened the day before (he had a confounded headache, and was just in his first sleep), and entreating Dob to engage comfortable rooms at the Slaughters' for Mr. Sedley and his servants. The Major had become necessary to Jos during the voyage. He was attached to him, and hung upon him. The other passengers were away to London. Young Ricketts and little Chaffers went away on the coach that day--Ricketts on the box, and taking the reins from Botley; the Doctor was off to his family at Portsea; Bragg gone to town to his co-partners; and the first mate busy in the unloading of the Ramchunder. Mr. Joe was very lonely at Southampton, and got the landlord of the George to take a glass of wine with him that day, at the very hour at which Major Dobbin was seated at the table of his father, Sir William, where his sister found out (for it was impossible for the Major to tell fibs) that he had been to see Mrs. George Osborne.\nJos was so comfortably situated in St. Martin's Lane, he could enjoy his hookah there with such perfect ease, and could swagger down to the theatres, when minded, so agreeably, that, perhaps, he would have remained altogether at the Slaughters' had not his friend, the Major, been at his elbow. That gentleman would not let the Bengalee rest until he had executed his promise of having a home for Amelia and his father. Jos was a soft fellow in anybody's hands, Dobbin most active in anybody's concerns but his own; the civilian was, therefore, an easy victim to the guileless arts of this good-natured diplomatist and was ready to do, to purchase, hire, or relinquish whatever his friend thought fit. Loll Jewab, of whom the boys about St. Martin's Lane used to make cruel fun whenever he showed his dusky countenance in the street, was sent back to Calcutta in the Lady Kicklebury East Indiaman, in which Sir William Dobbin had a share, having previously taught Jos's European the art of preparing curries, pilaus, and pipes. It was a matter of great delight and occupation to Jos to superintend the building of a smart chariot which he and the Major ordered in the neighbouring Long Acre: and a pair of handsome horses were jobbed, with which Jos drove about in state in the park, or to call upon his Indian friends. Amelia was not seldom by his side on these excursions, when also Major Dobbin would be seen in the back seat of the carriage. At other times old Sedley and his daughter took advantage of it, and Miss Clapp, who frequently accompanied her friend, had great pleasure in being recognized as she sat in the carriage, dressed in the famous yellow shawl, by the young gentleman at the surgery, whose face might commonly be seen over the window-blinds as she passed.\nShortly after Jos's first appearance at Brompton, a dismal scene, indeed, took place at that humble cottage at which the Sedleys had passed the last ten years of their life. Jos's carriage (the temporary one, not the chariot under construction) arrived one day and carried off old Sedley and his daughter--to return no more. The tears that were shed by the landlady and the landlady's daughter at that event were as genuine tears of sorrow as any that have been outpoured in the course of this history. In their long acquaintanceship and intimacy they could not recall a harsh word that had been uttered by Amelia. She had been all sweetness and kindness, always thankful, always gentle, even when Mrs. Clapp lost her own temper and pressed for the rent. When the kind creature was going away for good and all, the landlady reproached herself bitterly for ever having used a rough expression to her--how she wept, as they stuck up with wafers on the window, a paper notifying that the little rooms so long occupied were to let! They never would have such lodgers again, that was quite clear. After-life proved the truth of this melancholy prophecy, and Mrs. Clapp revenged herself for the deterioration of mankind by levying the most savage contributions upon the tea-caddies and legs of mutton of her locataires. Most of them scolded and grumbled; some of them did not pay; none of them stayed. The landlady might well regret those old, old friends, who had left her.\nAs for Miss Mary, her sorrow at Amelia's departure was such as I shall not attempt to depict. From childhood upwards she had been with her daily and had attached herself so passionately to that dear good lady that when the grand barouche came to carry her off into splendour, she fainted in the arms of her friend, who was indeed scarcely less affected than the good-natured girl. Amelia loved her like a daughter. During eleven years the girl had been her constant friend and associate. The separation was a very painful one indeed to her. But it was of course arranged that Mary was to come and stay often at the grand new house whither Mrs. Osborne was going, and where Mary was sure she would never be so happy as she had been in their humble cot, as Miss Clapp called it, in the language of the novels which she loved.\nLet us hope she was wrong in her judgement. Poor Emmy's days of happiness had been very few in that humble cot. A gloomy Fate had oppressed her there. She never liked to come back to the house after she had left it, or to face the landlady who had tyrannized over her when ill-humoured and unpaid, or when pleased had treated her with a coarse familiarity scarcely less odious. Her servility and fulsome compliments when Emmy was in prosperity were not more to that lady's liking. She cast about notes of admiration all over the new house, extolling every article of furniture or ornament; she fingered Mrs. Osborne's dresses and calculated their price. Nothing could be too good for that sweet lady, she vowed and protested. But in the vulgar sycophant who now paid court to her, Emmy always remembered the coarse tyrant who had made her miserable many a time, to whom she had been forced to put up petitions for time, when the rent was overdue; who cried out at her extravagance if she bought delicacies for her ailing mother or father; who had seen her humble and trampled upon her.\nNobody ever heard of these griefs, which had been part of our poor little woman's lot in life. She kept them secret from her father, whose improvidence was the cause of much of her misery. She had to bear all the blame of his misdoings, and indeed was so utterly gentle and humble as to be made by nature for a victim.\nI hope she is not to suffer much more of that hard usage. And, as in all griefs there is said to be some consolation, I may mention that poor Mary, when left at her friend's departure in a hysterical condition, was placed under the medical treatment of the young fellow from the surgery, under whose care she rallied after a short period. Emmy, when she went away from Brompton, endowed Mary with every article of furniture that the house contained, only taking away her pictures (the two pictures over the bed) and her piano--that little old piano which had now passed into a plaintive jingling old age, but which she loved for reasons of her own. She was a child when first she played on it, and her parents gave it her. It had been given to her again since, as the reader may remember, when her father's house was gone to ruin and the instrument was recovered out of the wreck.\nMajor Dobbin was exceedingly pleased when, as he was superintending the arrangements of Jos's new house--which the Major insisted should be very handsome and comfortable--the cart arrived from Brompton, bringing the trunks and bandboxes of the emigrants from that village, and with them the old piano. Amelia would have it up in her sitting-room, a neat little apartment on the second floor, adjoining her father's chamber, and where the old gentleman sat commonly of evenings.\nWhen the men appeared then bearing this old music-box, and Amelia gave orders that it should be placed in the chamber aforesaid, Dobbin was quite elated. \"I'm glad you've kept it,\" he said in a very sentimental manner. \"I was afraid you didn't care about it.\"\n\"I value it more than anything I have in the world,\" said Amelia.\n\"Do you, Amelia?\" cried the Major. The fact was, as he had bought it himself, though he never said anything about it, it never entered into his head to suppose that Emmy should think anybody else was the purchaser, and as a matter of course he fancied that she knew the gift came from him. \"Do you, Amelia?\" he said; and the question, the great question of all, was trembling on his lips, when Emmy replied--\n\"Can I do otherwise?--did not he give it me?\"\n\"I did not know,\" said poor old Dob, and his countenance fell.\nEmmy did not note the circumstance at the time, nor take immediate heed of the very dismal expression which honest Dobbin's countenance assumed, but she thought of it afterwards. And then it struck her, with inexpressible pain and mortification too, that it was William who was the giver of the piano, and not George, as she had fancied. It was not George's gift; the only one which she had received from her lover, as she thought--the thing she had cherished beyond all others--her dearest relic and prize. She had spoken to it about George; played his favourite airs upon it; sat for long evening hours, touching, to the best of her simple art, melancholy harmonies on the keys, and weeping over them in silence. It was not George's relic. It was valueless now. The next time that old Sedley asked her to play, she said it was shockingly out of tune, that she had a headache, that she couldn't play.\nThen, according to her custom, she rebuked herself for her pettishness and ingratitude and determined to make a reparation to honest William for the slight she had not expressed to him, but had felt for his piano. A few days afterwards, as they were seated in the drawing-room, where Jos had fallen asleep with great comfort after dinner, Amelia said with rather a faltering voice to Major Dobbin--\n\"I have to beg your pardon for something.\"\n\"About what?\" said he.\n\"About--about that little square piano. I never thanked you for it when you gave it me, many, many years ago, before I was married. I thought somebody else had given it. Thank you, William.\" She held out her hand, but the poor little woman's heart was bleeding; and as for her eyes, of course they were at their work.\nBut William could hold no more. \"Amelia, Amelia,\" he said, \"I did buy it for you. I loved you then as I do now. I must tell you. I think I loved you from the first minute that I saw you, when George brought me to your house, to show me the Amelia whom he was engaged to. You were but a girl, in white, with large ringlets; you came down singing--do you remember?--and we went to Vauxhall. Since then I have thought of but one woman in the world, and that was you. I think there is no hour in the day has passed for twelve years that I haven't thought of you. I came to tell you this before I went to India, but you did not care, and I hadn't the heart to speak. You did not care whether I stayed or went.\"\n\"I was very ungrateful,\" Amelia said.\n\"No, only indifferent,\" Dobbin continued desperately. \"I have nothing to make a woman to be otherwise. I know what you are feeling now. You are hurt in your heart at the discovery about the piano, and that it came from me and not from George. I forgot, or I should never have spoken of it so. It is for me to ask your pardon for being a fool for a moment, and thinking that years of constancy and devotion might have pleaded with you.\"\n\"It is you who are cruel now,\" Amelia said with some spirit. \"George is my husband, here and in heaven. How could I love any other but him? I am his now as when you first saw me, dear William. It was he who told me how good and generous you were, and who taught me to love you as a brother. Have you not been everything to me and my boy? Our dearest, truest, kindest friend and protector? Had you come a few months sooner perhaps you might have spared me that--that dreadful parting. Oh, it nearly killed me, William--but you didn't come, though I wished and prayed for you to come, and they took him too away from me. Isn't he a noble boy, William? Be his friend still and mine\"--and here her voice broke, and she hid her face on his shoulder.\nThe Major folded his arms round her, holding her to him as if she was a child, and kissed her head. \"I will not change, dear Amelia,\" he said. \"I ask for no more than your love. I think I would not have it otherwise. Only let me stay near you and see you often.\"\n\"Yes, often,\" Amelia said. And so William was at liberty to look and long--as the poor boy at school who has no money may sigh after the contents of the tart-woman's tray.",

        "text": "The Major's visit left old John Sedley in a great state of excitement. He passed the evening fumbling amongst his boxes, untying his papers with trembling hands, and sorting them for Jos's arrival. He got out his files, his receipts, and his lawyers' letters; the documents relating to the wine project, the coal project, the patent saw-mill, etc., etc. He passed the night in preparing these documents, trembling about from one room to another, with a quivering candle.\n\"He shall find no irregularity, Emmy,\" the old gentleman said.\nEmmy smiled. \"I don't think Jos will care about seeing those papers, Papa.\"\n\"You don't know anything about business, my dear,\" he answered. He arranged these twopenny documents on a side table, covered them carefully with a clean handkerchief, and solemnly asked the maid not to disturb them.\nAmelia found him up very early the next morning, more hectic and shaky than ever.\n\"I didn't sleep much, Emmy, my dear,\" he said. \"I was thinking of my poor Bessy. I wish she was alive, to ride in Jos's carriage once again.\" And his eyes filled with tears. Amelia wiped them away, and smilingly kissed him, and tied the old man's neckcloth; and in his Sunday suit, he sat from six o'clock in the morning awaiting the arrival of his son.\nHowever, the postman brought a letter from Jos to his sister, announcing that he felt a little fatigued after his voyage, and should not be able to move on that day, but would leave Southampton early the next morning and be with his father and mother at evening. Amelia, as she read out the letter, paused over the word mother. Her brother, it was clear, did not know what had happened.\nThere are some splendid tailors' shops in Southampton High Street, in whose windows hang gorgeous waistcoats of silk and velvet, and gold and crimson. Jos, although provided with the most splendid waistcoats that Calcutta could furnish, thought he could not go to town until he had one or two of these garments, and selected a crimson satin, embroidered with gold butterflies, and a black and red velvet tartan with white stripes, with which he thought he might make a dignified entry into London.\nFor Jos's former shyness had given way to a more courageous self-assertion. Though he was alarmed by the glances of the ladies, it was chiefly from a dread lest they should make love to him that he avoided them, being averse to marriage. But there was no such swell in Calcutta as Waterloo Sedley, I have heard say.\nTo make these waistcoats for a man of his size took at least a day. At length, he drove leisurely to London on the third day, in the new waistcoat, his native servant shivering on the box next to the new European servant; Jos puffing his pipe at intervals within and looking so majestic that people thought he must be a Governor-General.\nHe stopped frequently for refreshment: a glass of sherry at Winchester, ale at Alton, and at Farnham a light dinner of stewed eels, veal cutlets, French beans, and a bottle of claret. He felt cold over Bagshot Heath, and took some brandy-and-water; in fact, when he drove into town he was as full of wine, beer, meat, pickles, cherry-brandy, and tobacco as the steward's cabin of a steam-packet. It was evening when his carriage thundered up to the little door in Brompton.\nAll the faces in the street were in the windows; the maidservant flew to the gate; Emmy, in a great flutter, was in the passage, and old Sedley in the parlour, shaking all over. Jos descended from the post-chaise in great state, supported by his new valet and the shuddering native, who was now bluish-grey with cold, and who created an immense sensation with the Clapps.\nWe shall shut the door upon the meeting between Jos and his family. The old man was very much affected; so was his daughter; nor was Jos without feeling. Jos was unaffectedly glad to see and shake the hand of his father, between whom and himself there had been a coolness - glad to see his pretty little sister, and pained at the alteration in the shattered old man. Emmy had come to the door in her black clothes and whispered to him of her mother's death, asking him not to speak of it to their father. However, the elder Sedley himself began immediately to talk of the event, and wept over it. It shocked Jos and made him think about himself less than usual.\nAfter Jos had driven away to his hotel, Emmy embraced her father tenderly, asking the old man whether she did not always say that her brother had a good heart?\nIndeed, Joseph Sedley, affected by the humble position in which he found his relations, had declared that they should never suffer want or discomfort any more; that his house and everything he had should be theirs: and that Amelia would look very pretty at the head of his table - until she should accept one of her own.\nShe shook her head sadly and had, as usual, recourse to the waterworks. She knew what he meant. She and young Polly Clapp had talked very fully on the night of the Major's visit, and Polly could not refrain from telling her of the discovery which she had made, and how Major Dobbin had betrayed himself by his tremor of joy when Mr. Binny passed with his bride.\n\"Oh, Ma'am,\" she said, \"he never kept his eyes off you, and I'm sure he's grown grey athinking of you.\"\nBut Amelia, looking up at the portraits of her husband and son, told her never to speak on that subject again; that Major Dobbin had been her husband's dearest friend and her own kind guardian; that she loved him as a brother - but that a woman who had been married to such an angel as that could never think of another union.\nPoor Polly sighed: she thought of young Mr. Tomkins, at the surgery, whose glances at church put her timorous little heart into a flutter - what would she do if he were to die? She knew he was consumptive, his cheeks were so red and he was so thin.\nNot that Emmy felt displeased with the honest Major. Such an attachment from so loyal a gentleman could make no woman angry. Why, Miranda was even kind to Caliban, we may be pretty sure, for the same reason. Not that she would encourage the poor uncouth monster - of course not. Nor would Emmy encourage the Major. She would treat him with perfect cordiality and frankness until he made his proposals, and then it would be time enough for her to speak and put an end to his impossible hopes.\nShe slept, therefore, very soundly that evening, and was more than ordinarily happy.\n\"I am glad he is not going to marry that Miss O'Dowd,\" she thought. \"She could not be fit for such an accomplished man as Major William.\" Who would make him a good wife? Not Miss Binny, she was too ill-tempered. Miss Osborne? too old. Little Polly was too young. She could not find anybody to suit the Major before she went to sleep.\nThe same morning a letter came for Major Dobbin at the Slaughters' Coffee-house from Jos in Southampton, begging dear Dob to excuse him for being in a rage the day before (he had a confounded headache), and entreating Dob to book rooms at the Slaughters' for Mr. Sedley and his servants. Jos was very lonely at Southampton.\nOnce at the Slaughters', though, he could enjoy his hookah with such perfect ease, and could swagger down to the theatres so agreeably that perhaps he would have remained there had not the Major insisted that he should have a home for Amelia and his father. Dobbin was most active in anybody's concerns but his own; Jos was a soft fellow in anyone's hands, and was ready to do whatever his friend thought fit. His Indian servant was sent back to Calcutta, having taught Jos's European man the art of preparing curries, pilaus and a pipe. Jos had a smart carriage built in which he drove about in state, frequently with Amelia and Major Dobbin. At other times old Sedley and his daughter rode out; and Miss Clapp, who accompanied her friend, had great pleasure in being recognized, as she sat in the carriage, by the young gentleman at the surgery.\nShortly after Jos's appearance at Brompton, a dismal scene took place at the Clapps' humble cottage. Jos's carriage arrived one day and carried off old Sedley and his daughter - to return no more. The landlady and her daughter shed genuine tears of sorrow; they could not recall a harsh word from Amelia. She had been all sweetness and kindness, even when Mrs. Clapp lost her own temper and pressed for the rent. When the kind creature was going away, the landlady reproached herself bitterly. They would never have such lodgers again, that was quite clear.\nAs for Miss Polly, her sorrow was such as I shall not attempt to depict. She had attached herself so passionately to Amelia that when the grand barouche came to carry her off, she fainted in her friend's arms. Indeed, Amelia loved her like a daughter, and the separation was very painful to her. But it was of course arranged that Polly would come and stay often at the grand new house where Mrs. Osborne was going, and where Polly was sure she could never be so happy as at the Clapps' humble home.\nLet us hope she was wrong. Poor Emmy's days of happiness in that home had been very few. Fate had oppressed her: the landlady had tyrannized over her when unpaid, and Mrs. Clapp's servility and fulsome compliments about the new house were no more to Emmy's liking. Emmy always remembered the coarse tyrant who had made her miserable; who had cried out at her extravagance if she bought delicacies for her ailing parents; who had seen her humble, and trampled upon her.\nI hope Amelia is not to suffer more of that hard usage. And, as in all griefs there is some consolation, I may mention that Polly, when in a hysterical condition at her friend's departure, was placed under the medical treatment of the young fellow from the surgery, in whose care she soon rallied. Emmy gave her every bit of furniture that she had at Brompton, only taking away her pictures and her piano - that little old piano which had now passed into a plaintive jingling old age, but which she loved for reasons of her own.\nMajor Dobbin was exceedingly pleased when, as he was superintending the move to Jos's new house, the cart arrived from Brompton, bringing trunks and the old piano. Amelia wanted it up in her sitting-room on the second floor, next to her father's chamber. When the men appeared bearing the piano, Dobbin was quite elated.\n\"I'm glad you've kept it,\" he said. \"I was afraid you didn't care about it.\"\n\"I value it more than anything I have in the world,\" said Amelia.\n\"Do you, Amelia?\" cried the Major. The fact was, as he had bought it himself, it never entered into his head to suppose that Emmy should think anybody else was the purchaser. He thought that she knew the gift came from him.\n\"Do you, Amelia?\" he said; and the question, the great question of all, was trembling on his lips, when Emmy replied:\n\"Of course. Did not he give it me?\"\n\"I did not know,\" said poor old Dob, and his face fell.\nEmmy did not heed this at the time, but she thought of it afterwards. And then it struck her, with inexpressible pain and mortification, that it was William who was the giver of the piano, and not George. It was not, as she had thought, George's gift; her dearest relic. She had spoken to it about George; played his favourite airs upon it; sat for long evening hours, touching melancholy harmonies on the keys, and weeping over them in silence. It was valueless now. The next time old Sedley asked her to play, she said it was shockingly out of tune, that she had a headache, that she couldn't play it.\nThen she rebuked herself for her pettish ingratitude and determined to make up for the slight she had not expressed to honest William, but had felt for his piano. A few days afterwards, as they were seated in the drawing-room, where Jos had fallen asleep after dinner, Amelia said falteringly to Major Dobbin, \"I have to beg your pardon for something.\"\n\"About what?\"\n\"About that little piano. I never thanked you for it when you gave it me, many, many years ago. I thought somebody else had given it. Thank you, William.\" She held out her hand, but the poor little woman's heart was bleeding.\nWilliam could hold back no more. \"Amelia, Amelia,\" he said, \"I did buy it for you. I loved you then as I do now. I must tell you. I think I loved you from the first minute that I saw you, when George took me to meet you. You were only a girl, in white, with ringlets; you came down singing - do you remember? - and we went to Vauxhall. Since then I have thought of but one woman in the world, and that was you. No hour in the day has passed for twelve years that I haven't thought of you. I came to tell you this before I went to India, but I hadn't the heart to speak. You did not care whether I stayed or went.\"\n\"I was very ungrateful,\" Amelia said.\n\"No, only indifferent,\" Dobbin continued desperately. \"I have nothing to make a woman be otherwise. I know what you are feeling now. You are hurt at discovering that the piano came from me and not from George. I forgot that, and I beg your pardon for being a fool for a moment, and thinking that years of constancy and devotion might have pleaded with you.\"\n\"It is you who are cruel now,\" Amelia said with some spirit. \"George is my husband, here and in heaven. How could I love any other but him? I am his now as when you first saw me, dear William. It was he who told me how good and generous you were, and who taught me to love you as a brother. Have you not been our dearest, truest, kindest friend and protector? Had you come a few months sooner perhaps you might have spared me that - that dreadful parting from my boy. Oh, it nearly killed me, William. Isn't he a noble boy, William? Be his friend still and mine-\" and here her voice broke, and she hid her face on his shoulder.\nThe Major folded his arms round her, as if she was a child, and kissed her head.\n\"I will not change, dear Amelia,\" he said. \"I ask for no more than your love. Only let me stay near you and see you often.\"\n\"Yes, often,\" Amelia said. And so William was at liberty to look and yearn - just as the poor schoolboy with no money may sigh after the contents of the tart-woman's tray.",
