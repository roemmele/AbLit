(as the case happens)--that the soil was grateful, and that nature pours out all her abundance, &c. . . . they have then a large plain upon their hands, which they know not what to do with--and which is of little or no use to them but to carry them to some town; and that town, perhaps of little more, but a new place to start from to the next plain----and so on.\n--This is most terrible work; judge if I don't manage my plains better.",
