'And he was whipped, your honour, almost to death's door.'\n'I thank thee, Trim,' quoth my uncle Toby.\n'I never think of it,' continued Trim, 'and my poor brother Tom's misfortunes - for we were all school-fellows - without crying like a coward.'\n'Tears are no proof of cowardice, Trim. I drop them often myself,' cried my uncle Toby.\n'I know your honour does,' replied Trim, 'and so am not ashamed of it. - But to think of two virtuous lads with hearts as warm and honest as God could make them - going forth with gallant spirits to seek their fortunes - and falling into such evils! poor Tom! to be tortured upon a rack for nothing but marrying a Jew's widow who sold sausages - and honest Dick Johnson's soul to be scourged out of his body, for the ducats another man put into his knapsack! O! these are misfortunes, your honour, worth lying down and crying over.'\nMy father could not help blushing.\n''Twould be a pity, Trim,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'if thou shouldst ever feel sorrow of thy own - thou feelest it so tenderly for others.'\n'Alack-o-day,' replied the corporal, brightening up, 'your honour knows I have neither wife or child - I can have no sorrows in this world.' My father could not help smiling.\n'As few as any man, Trim,' replied my uncle Toby; 'yet thou couldst suffer from the distress of poverty in thy old age, when thou hast outlived thy friends.'\n'Never fear, your honour,' replied Trim cheerily.\n'But I would have thee never fear, Trim,' replied my uncle; 'and therefore' - standing up - 'therefore in recompense of thy long fidelity to me, and the goodness of thy heart - thou shalt never ask elsewhere, Trim, for a penny.'\nTrim attempted to thank my uncle Toby - but tears trickled down his cheeks faster than he could wipe them off. He laid his hands upon his breast - made a bow, and shut the door.\n'I have left Trim my bowling-green,' cried my uncle Toby. - My father smiled.\n'I have left him moreover a pension,' continued my uncle Toby. - My father looked grave.",
