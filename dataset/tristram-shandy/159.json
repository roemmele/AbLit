Or chronologically, --_Has it been always?_ _Lately?_ _How long ago?_ --Or hypothetically, --_If it was?_ _If it was not?_ What would follow? ----If the _French_ should beat the _English?_ If the _Sun_ go out of the _Zodiac?_\nNow, by the right use and application of these, continued my father, in which a child's memory should be exercised, there is no one idea can enter his brain, how barren soever, but a magazine of conceptions and conclusions may be drawn forth from it. ----Didst thou ever see a white bear? cried my father, turning his head round to _Trim_, who stood at the back of his chair: --No, an' please your honour, replied the corporal. ----But thou couldst discourse about one, _Trim_, said my father, in case of need? --How is it possible, brother, quoth my uncle _Toby_, if the corporal never saw one? ----'Tis the fact I want, replied my father, --and the possibility of it is as follows.\nA WHITE BEAR! Very well. Have I ever seen one? Might I ever have seen one? Am I ever to see one? Ought I ever to have seen one? Or can I ever see one?\nWould I had seen a white bear! (for how can I imagine it?)\nIf I should see a white bear, what would I say? If I should never see a white bear, what then?\nIf I never have, can, must, or shall see a white bear alive; have I ever seen the skin of one? Did I ever see one painted? --described? Have I never dreamed of one?\nDid my father, mother, uncle, aunt, brothers or sisters, ever see a white bear? What would they give? How would they behave? How would the white bear have behaved? Is he wild? Tame? Terrible? Rough? Smooth?\n--Is the white bear worth seeing?--\n--Is there no sin in it?--\nIs it better than a BLACK ONE?",

And these varied with tenses, present, past, or future, or with these questions added to them - Is it? Was it? Will it be? Would it be? May it be? Might it be? And these again put negatively: Is it not? Was it not? Or chronologically - Has it been always? Lately? How long ago? Or hypothetically: If it was? If it was not? - if the French should beat the English? If the Sun should go out of the Zodiac?\n'Now, by the right use of these,' continued my father, 'no idea can enter a child's brain, without a crowd of ideas being drawn forth from it. - Didst thou ever see a white bear?' he cried, turning to Trim.\n'No, your honour,' replied the corporal.\n'But thou couldst talk about one, Trim,' said my father, 'if needed?\n'How is it possible, brother,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'if the corporal never saw one?'\n'That is the fact I want,' replied my father. 'The possibility of it is as follows.\n'A White Bear! Very well. Have I ever seen one? Might I ever have seen one? Am I ever to see one? Ought I ever to have seen one? Or can I ever see one?\n'Would I had seen a white bear!\n'If I should see a white bear, what would I say? If I should never see a white bear, what then?\n'If I never have, can, must, or shall see a white bear alive; have I ever seen the skin of one? Did I ever see one painted? - described? Have I never dreamed of one?\n'Did my father, mother, uncle, aunt, brothers or sisters, ever see a white bear? What would they give? How would they behave?\n'How would the white bear have behaved? Is he wild? Tame? Terrible? Rough? Smooth?\n'Is the white bear worth seeing?\n'Is there no sin in it?\n'Is it better than a black one?'",
