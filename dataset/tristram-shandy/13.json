Could a historiographer drive on his history, as a muleteer drives on his mule, --straight forward; ----for instance, from _Rome_ all the way to _Loretto_, without ever once turning his head aside either to the right hand or to the left, ----he might venture to foretell you to an hour when he should get to his journey's end; ----but the thing is, morally speaking, impossible: For, if he is a man of the least spirit, he will have fifty deviations from a straight line to make with this or that party as he goes along, which he can no ways avoid. He will have views and prospects to himself perpetually soliciting his eye, which he can no more help standing still to look at than he can fly; he will moreover have various\nAccounts to reconcile:\nAnecdotes to pick up:\nInscriptions to make out:\nStories to weave in:\nTraditions to sift:\nPersonages to call upon:\nPanegyricks to paste up at this door;\nPasquinades at that: ----All which both the man and his mule are quite exempt from. To sum up all; there are archives at every stage to be look'd into, and rolls, records, documents, and endless genealogies, which justice ever and anon calls him back to stay the reading of: ----In short, there is no end of it; ----for my own part, I declare I had been at it these six weeks, making all the speed I possibly could, --and am not yet born: --I have just been able, and that's all, to tell you _when_ it happen'd, but not _how_; --so that you see the thing is yet far from being accomplished.\nThese unforeseen stoppages, which I own I had no conception of when I first set out; --but which, I am convinced now, will rather increase than diminish as I advance, --have struck out a hint which I am resolved to follow; ----and that is, --not to be in a hurry; but to go on leisurely, writing and publishing two volumes of my life every year; ----which, if I am suffered to go on quietly, and can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller, I shall continue to do as long as I live.",

        "text": "Upon looking into my mother's marriage-settlement, in order to clear up a point before proceeding any farther in this history - I had the good fortune to pop upon the very thing I wanted, before I had read for a day and a half. It might have taken me a month; which shows plainly, that when a man sits down to write a history, even if only the history of Tom Thumb, he has no idea what confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his way, or what a dance he may be led before all is over.\nCould a writer drive his history straight forward, as a muleteer drives on his mule, without ever once turning his head either to right or left, he could foretell to the hour when he should get to his journey's end; but the thing is, morally speaking, impossible. For, if he is a man of the least spirit, he will have fifty deviations to make as he goes along, which he cannot avoid. He will have views perpetually catching his eye, which he can no more help stopping to look at than he can fly; he will moreover have various\nAccounts to reconcile:\nAnecdotes to pick up:\nInscriptions to make out:\nStories to weave in:\nTraditions to sift:\nPersonages to call upon:\nPanegyrics to paste up: - All which both the man and his mule are quite exempt from.\nTo sum up; there are archives at every stage to be looked into, and records, documents, and endless genealogies that he must read. - In short, there is no end of it. For my own part, I declare I have been at it these six weeks, making all the speed I possibly could, - and am not yet born. I have just been able to tell you when it happened, but not how; - so that you see the thing is still far from being accomplished.\nThese unforeseen stoppages, which I had no conception of when I first set out - but which, I am now convinced, will increase rather than diminish as I advance - have made me resolve not to be in a hurry; but to go on leisurely, writing and publishing two volumes of my life every year; - which, if I can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller, I shall continue to do as long as I live.",
