In St. _James_ of the Shambles, fifty-five streets. In St. _Oportune_, thirty-four streets. In the quarter of the _Louvre_, twenty-five streets. In the _Palace Royal_, or St. _Honorius_, forty-nine streets. In _Mont. Martyr_, forty-one streets. In St. _Eustace_, twenty-nine streets. In the _Halles_, twenty-seven streets. In St. _Dennis_, fifty-five streets. In St. _Martin_, fifty-four streets. In St. _Paul_, or the _Mortellerie_, twenty-seven streets. The _Greve_, thirty-eight streets. In St. _Avoy_, or the _Verrerie_, nineteen streets. In the _Marais_, or the _Temple_, fifty-two streets. In St. _Antony's_, sixty-eight streets. In the _Place Maubert_, eighty-one streets. In St. _Bennet_, sixty streets. In St. _Andrews de Arcs_, fifty-one streets. In the quarter of the _Luxembourg_, sixty-two streets.\nAnd in that of St. Germain, fifty-five streets, into any of which you may walk; and that when you have seen them with all that belongs to them, fairly by day-light--their gates, their bridges, their squares, their statues - - - and have crusaded it moreover, through all their parish-churches, by no means omitting St. _Roche_ and _Sulpice_ - - - and to crown all, have taken a walk to the four palaces, which you may see, either with or without the statues and pictures, just as you chuse--\n----Then you will have seen----\n----but, 'tis what no one needeth to tell you, for you will read of it yourself upon the portico of the _Louvre_, in these words,\n[7.3]EARTH NO SUCH FOLKS! --NO FOLKS E'ER SUCH A TOWN AS PARIS IS! --SING, DERRY, DERRY, DOWN.\nThe _French_ have a _gay_ way of treating everything that is Great; and that is all can be said upon it.\n[Footnote 7.3: Non orbis gentem, non urbem gens habet ullam --------ulla parem.]",

But 'tis evident to me, when people say 'That they who have seen Paris, have seen everything,' they must mean those who have seen it by day-light.\nAs for candle-light - I give it up - there was no depending upon it; in all the five hundred grand Hotels in Paris, and the five hundred good things (allowing one good thing to a Hotel), which by candle-light are best to be seen, felt, heard, and understood (which, by the bye, is a quotation from Lilly) - barely one of us out of fifty can get our heads thrust in amongst them.\n'Tis simply this,\nThat by the last survey taken in the year 1716, Paris did contain nine hundred streets; (viz.)\nIn the quarter called the City, there are fifty-three streets.\nIn St. James of the Shambles, fifty-five streets.\nIn St. Oportune, thirty-four streets.\nIn the quarter of the Louvre, twenty-five streets.\nIn the Palace Royal, or St. Honorius, forty-nine streets.\nIn Mont. Martyr, forty-one streets.\nIn St. Eustace, twenty-nine streets.\nIn the Halles, twenty-seven streets.\nIn St. Dennis, fifty-five streets.\nIn St. Martin, fifty-four streets.\nAnd in a further ten quarters, five hundred and thirteen streets, into any of which you may walk; and when you have seen them by day-light - their gates, bridges, squares, and statues - and have crusaded moreover, through all their parish-churches, - and to crown all, have taken a walk to the four palaces-\nThen you will have seen-\n- but no one needs tell you what, for you will read of it yourself upon the portico of the Louvre, in these words,\nEARTH NO SUCH FOLKS!\nNO FOLKS E'ER SUCH A TOWN AS PARIS IS!\nSING, DERRY, DERRY, DOWN.\nNon orbis gentem, non urbem gens habet ullam - - - ulla parem.\nThe French have a gay way of treating everything that is Great; and that is all that can be said.",
