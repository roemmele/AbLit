        "text": "Why weavers, gardeners, and gladiators - or a man with a wasted leg - should ever have had some tender nymph breaking her heart in secret for them, are points well accounted for by ancient and modern physiologists.\nA water-drinker, provided he is a professed one, and does it without fraud, is precisely in the same predicament: not that, at first sight, there is any logic in it, 'That a rill of cold water dribbling through my inward parts, should light up a torch in my Jenny's-'\n- It seems to run opposite to the natural workings of causes and effects-\nBut it shows the weakness of human reason.\n- 'And you are in perfect good health? And drink nothing but water?'\nImpetuous fluid! the moment thou pressest against the flood-gates of the brain - see how they give way!\nIn swims Curiosity with her damsels - they dive into the centre of the current-\nFancy sits musing upon the bank, and, watching the stream, turns straws and bulrushes into masts and bowsprits. And Desire, with her vest held up in one hand, snatches at them with the other, as they swim by-\nO ye water-drinkers! is it by this delusive fountain, that ye have so often turned this world around like a mill-wheel - grinding the faces of the impotent - bepeppering their noses, and changing the very face of nature-\n'If I was you,' quoth Yorick, 'I would drink more water, Eugenius.'\n'And, if I was you, Yorick,' replied Eugenius, 'so would I.'\nWhich shows they had both read Longinus-\nFor my own part, I am resolved never to read any book but my own, as long as I live.",
