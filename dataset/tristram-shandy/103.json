''Twas Susannah's and the curate's folly betwixt them.'\n'What business could they have together in the garden?'\n'In the gallery, thou meanest,' replied my uncle.\nTrim found he was upon a wrong scent, and stopped short. Two misfortunes, quoth he to himself, are twice as many as are needed now; - the mischief the cow has done in breaking into the fortifications, may be told to his honour later.\nMy uncle Toby, free of all suspicion, went on:\n'For my own part, Trim, I can see little difference betwixt my nephew's being called Tristram or Trismegistus - though as it sits so near my brother's heart, I would have given a hundred pounds for it not to have happened.'\n'A hundred pounds, your honour!' replied Trim. 'I would not give a cherry-stone.'\n'Nor would I, Trim, upon my own account; but my brother, whom there is no arguing with in this case, maintains that a great deal depends upon christian-names - and he says there never was an heroic action performed by one called Tristram. He holds that a Tristram cannot be learned, wise, or brave.'\n''Tis all fancy, your honour - I fought just as well,' replied the corporal, 'when the regiment called me Trim, as when they called me James Butler.'\n'For my own part,' said my uncle Toby, 'though I should blush to boast, Trim - yet had my name been Alexander, I could have done no more at Namur than my duty.'\n'Bless your honour!' cried Trim, 'does a man think of his christian-name when he goes upon the attack?'\n'Or when he stands in the trench, Trim?' cried my uncle.\n'Or when he enters a breach?' said Trim, pushing between two chairs.\n'Or forces the lines?' said my uncle, rising up.\n'Or faces a platoon?' cried Trim, raising his stick.\n'Or when he marches up the glacis?' cried my uncle Toby warmly, as he set his foot upon the stool.",
