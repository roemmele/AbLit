        "text": "\"_Make them like unto a wheel_,\" is a bitter sarcasm, as all the learned know, against the _grand tour_, and that restless spirit for making it, which _David_ prophetically foresaw would haunt the children of men in the latter days; and therefore, as thinketh the great bishop _Hall_, 'tis one of the severest imprecations which _David_ ever utter'd against the enemies of the Lord--and, as if he had said, \"I wish them no worse luck than always to be rolling about\" --So much motion, continues he (for he was very corpulent)--is so much unquietness; and so much of rest, by the same analogy, is so much of heaven.\nNow, I (being very thin) think differently; and that so much of motion, is so much of life, and so much of joy----and that to stand still, or get on but slowly, is death and the devil----\nHollo! Ho! ----the whole world's asleep! ----bring out the horses----grease the wheels--tie on the mail----and drive a nail into that moulding ----I'll not lose a moment----\nNow the wheel we are talking of, and _whereinto_ (but not _whereunto_, for that would make an Ixion's wheel of it) he curseth his enemies, according to the bishop's habit of body, should certainly be a post-chaise wheel, whether they were set up in _Palestine_ at that time or not----and my wheel, for the contrary reasons, must as certainly be a cart-wheel groaning round its revolution once in an age; and of which sort, were I to turn commentator, I should make no scruple to affirm, they had great store in that hilly country.\nI love the Pythagoreans (much more than ever I dare tell my dear _Jenny_) for their \" , \"---- [their] \"_getting out of the body, in order to think well_.\" No man thinks right, whilst he is in it; blinded as he must be, with his congenial humours, and drawn differently aside, as the bishop and myself have been, with too lax or too tense a fibre ----REASON is, half of it, SENSE; and the measure of heaven itself is but the measure of our present appetites and concoctions----\n----But which of the two, in the present case, do you think to be mostly in the wrong?\nYou, certainly: quoth she, to disturb a whole family so early.",
