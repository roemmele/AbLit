But, Sir, replied Dr. _Slop_, not taking notice of my uncle _Toby's_ opinion, but turning to my father, --they had better govern in other points; ----and a father of a family, who wishes its perpetuity, in my opinion, had better exchange this prerogative with them, and give up some other rights in lieu of it. ----I know not, quoth my father, answering a little too testily, to be quite dispassionate in what he said, --I know not, quoth he, what we have left to give up, in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world, unless that, --of who shall beget them. ------One would almost give up anything, replied Dr. _Slop_. --I beg your pardon, ----answered my uncle _Toby_. --Sir, replied Dr. _Slop_, it would astonish you to know what improvements we have made of late years in all branches of obstetrical knowledge, but particularly in that one single point of the safe and expeditious extraction of the _ftus_, ----which has received such lights, that, for my part (holding up his hands) I declare I wonder how the world has ----I wish, quoth my uncle _Toby_, you had seen what prodigious armies we had in _Flanders_.",
