        "text": "To those who call vexations, VEXATIONS, as knowing what they are, there could not be a greater, than to be the best part of a day at _Lyons_, the most opulent and flourishing city in _France_, enriched with the most fragments of antiquity--and not be able to see it. To be withheld upon _any_ account, must be a vexation; but to be withheld _by_ a vexation----must certainly be, what philosophy justly calls\nVEXATION upon VEXATION.\nI had got my two dishes of milk coffee (which by the bye is excellently good for a consumption, but you must boil the milk and coffee together--otherwise 'tis only coffee and milk)--and as it was no more than eight in the morning, and the boat did not go off till noon, I had time to see enough of _Lyons_ to tire the patience of all the friends I had in the world with it. I will take a walk to the cathedral, said I, looking at my list, and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of _Lippius_ of _Basil_, in the first place----\nNow, of all things in the world, I understand the least of mechanism ----I have neither genius, or taste, or fancy--and have a brain so entirely unapt for everything of that kind, that I solemnly declare I was never yet able to comprehend the principles of motion of a squirrel cage, or a common knife-grinder's wheel--tho' I have many an hour of my life look'd up with great devotion at the one--and stood by with as much patience as any christian ever could do, at the other----\nI'll go see the surprising movements of this great clock, said I, the very first thing I do: and then I will pay a visit to the great library of the Jesuits, and procure, if possible, a sight of the thirty volumes of the general history of _China_, wrote (not in the _Tartarean_, but) in the _Chinese_ language, and in the _Chinese_ character too.\nNow I almost know as little of the _Chinese_ language, as I do of the mechanism of _Lippius's_ clock-work; so, why these should have jostled themselves into the two first articles of my list ----I leave to the curious as a problem of Nature. I own it looks like one of her ladyship's obliquities; and they who court her, are interested in finding out her humour as much as I.\nWhen these curiosities are seen, quoth I, half addressing myself to my _valet de place_, who stood behind me----'twill be no hurt if we go to the church of St. _Irenus_, and see the pillar to which _Christ_ was tied----and after that, the house where _Pontius Pilate_ lived----'Twas at the next town, said the _valet de place_--at _Vienne_; I am glad of it, said I, rising briskly from my chair, and walking across the room with strides twice as long as my usual pace---- \"for so much the sooner shall I be at the _Tomb of the two lovers_.\"\nWhat was the cause of this movement, and why I took such long strides in uttering this ----I might leave to the curious too; but as no principle of clock-work is concerned in it----'twill be as well for the reader if I explain it myself.",

To be withheld for any reason, must be a vexation; but to be withheld by a vexation must certainly be\nVEXATION\nupon\nVEXATION.\nI had got my two dishes of milky coffee (which by the bye is excellently good for a consumption, but you must boil the milk and coffee together - otherwise 'tis only coffee and milk) - and as it was only eight in the morning, and the boat did not go till noon, I had time to see some of Lyons.\n'I will walk to the cathedral,' said I, 'and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of Lippius.'\nNow, of all things in the world, I understand the least of mechanism. I was never yet able to comprehend the principles of a squirrel cage, or a knife-grinder's wheel.\n'First I'll see the surprising movements of this great clock,' said I; 'and then I will visit the great library of the Jesuits, and get a sight of the thirty volumes of the history of China, wrote in the Chinese language.'\nNow I know as little of the Chinese language as I do of the mechanism of Lippius's clock-work; so why these two should have jostled themselves into my mind, I know not.\n'When these curiosities are seen,' quoth I to my valet, 'we will go to the church of St. Ireneus, and see the pillar to which Christ was tied, and then the house where Pontius Pilate lived.'\n''Twas at the next town,' said he, 'at Vienne.'\n'I am glad,' said I, rising briskly, and striding across the room- 'for so much the sooner shall I be at the Tomb of the two lovers.'\nWhy I took long strides in uttering this, I will explain.",
