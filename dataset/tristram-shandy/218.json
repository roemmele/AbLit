I still continue in the same sentiments--only I had not then experience enough of its working to add this, that though you do get on at a tearing rate, yet you get on but uneasily to yourself at the same time; for which reason I here quit it entirely, and for ever, and 'tis heartily at any one's service--it has spoiled me the digestion of a good supper, and brought on a bilious diarrha, which has brought me back again to my first principle on which I set out----and with which I shall now scamper it away to the banks of the _Garonne_--\n----No; ----I cannot stop a moment to give you the character of the people--their genius----their manners--their customs--their laws----their religion--their government--their manufactures--their commerce--their finances, with all the resources and hidden springs which sustain them: qualified as I may be, by spending three days and two nights amongst them, and during all that time making these things the entire subject of my enquiries and reflections----\nStill--still I must away----the roads are paved--the posts are short--the days are long--'tis no more than noon --I shall be at _Fontainbleau_ before the king----\n--Was he going there? not that I know----",
