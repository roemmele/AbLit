As the dialogue was of _Erasmus_, my father soon came to himself, and read it over and over again with great application, studying every word and every syllable of it thro' and thro' in its most strict and literal interpretation--he could still make nothing of it, that way. Mayhap there is more meant, than is said in it, quoth my father. ----Learned men, brother _Toby_, don't write dialogues upon long noses for nothing. ------I'll study the mystick and the allegorick sense----here is some room to turn a man's self in, brother.\nMy father read on. ------Now I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships, that besides the many nautical uses of long noses enumerated by _Erasmus_, the dialogist affirmeth that a long nose is not without its domestic conveniencies also; for that in a case of distress--and for want of a pair of bellows, it will do excellently well, _ad ixcitandum focum_ (to stir up the fire).\nNature had been prodigal in her gifts to my father beyond measure, and had sown the seeds of verbal criticism as deep within him, as she had done the seeds of all other knowledge------so that he had got out his penknife, and was trying experiments upon the sentence, to see if he could not scratch some better sense into it. ----I've got within a single letter, brother _Toby_, cried my father, of _Erasmus_ his mystic meaning. --You are near enough, brother, replied my uncle, in all conscience. ------Pshaw! cried my father, scratching on ----I might as well be seven miles off. --I've done it--said my father, snapping his fingers --See, my dear brother _Toby_, how I have mended the sense. ----But you have marr'd a word, replied my uncle _Toby_. ----My father put on his spectacles----bit his lip------and tore out the leaf in a passion.",

'Nec est cur poeniteat,' replies Cocles; that is, 'How the deuce should such a nose fail?'\nThis was laid down by Erasmus with great plainness; but my father was disappointed to find no subtler argument from so able a pen.\nMy father pished and pughed at first most terribly. But as the dialogue was by Erasmus, he soon read it over again with great application, studying every word through and through.\nHe could still make nothing of it. 'Mayhap more is meant than is said in it,' quoth he. 'Learned men don't write dialogues upon long noses for nothing. I'll study the mystic and allegoric sense.'\nMy father read on. Now I must inform your worships, that besides the many nautical uses of long noses listed by Erasmus, he writes that a long nose has its domestic conveniences also; for instance, in the want of a pair of bellows, it will do excellently well ad excitandum focum (to arouse the fire.)\nMy father had got out his penknife, and was trying experiments upon the sentence, to see if he could not scratch some better sense into it.\n'I've got within a single letter, brother Toby,' cried he, scratching on, 'of Erasmus's mystic meaning. I've done it,' he said, snapping his fingers. 'See, my dear brother, how I have mended the sense.'\n'But you have marred a word,' replied my uncle Toby. My father bit his lip - and tore the page out in a passion.",
