I love to lie hard and alone, and even without my wife ----This last word may stagger the faith of the world----but remember, \"La Vraisemblance (as _Bayle_ says in the affair of _Liceti_) n'est pas toujours du Ct de la Verit.\" And so much for sleep.",

Button-holes! there is something lively in the very idea of 'em - and trust me, when I get amongst 'em - You gentry look as grave as you will - I'll make merry work with my button-holes. I shall have 'em all to myself - 'tis a maiden subject - I shall run foul of no man's fine sayings in it.\nBut as for sleep - I know I shall make nothing of it before I begin. I am no dab hand at fine sayings in the first place, and in the next, I cannot for my soul look grave, and tell the world 'tis the refuge of the unfortunate - the freedom of the prisoner - the comfort of the hopeless and the weary; nor could I lie by affirming, that - of all the delicious functions of our nature, by which God, in his bounty, has been pleased to recompense the sufferings wherewith his justice has wearied us - that this is the chiefest (for I know pleasures worth ten of it); or what a happiness it is to man, when the anxieties of the day are over, and he lies back, with the heavens looking calm and sweet above him - no fear or doubt troubling him.\n'God's blessing,' said Sancho Panza, 'be upon the man who first invented this thing called sleep - it covers a man like a cloak.' Now this speaks warmer to my heart than all the dissertations squeezed out of the heads of the learned.\nNot that I altogether disapprove of what Montaigne says - 'tis admirable in its way; (I quote by memory):\n'The world enjoys other pleasures,' says he, 'as they do that of sleep, without feeling it as it slips by. We should ruminate upon it, in order to give proper thanks to him who grants it to us. I cause myself to be disturbed in my sleep, so that I may the better relish it. And yet I see few,' says he, 'who sleep less than me. I love to lie hard and alone, and even without my wife. This last may stagger the world - but remember, \"La Vraisemblance n'est pas toujours du Ct de la Verit.\"' And so much for sleep.",
