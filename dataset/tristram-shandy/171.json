        "text": "When my uncle _Toby_ had turned everything into money, and settled all accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and _Le Fever_, and betwixt _Le Fever_ and all mankind, ----there remained nothing more in my uncle _Toby's_ hands, than an old regimental coat and a sword; so that my uncle _Toby_ found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration. The coat my uncle _Toby_ gave the corporal; ----Wear it, _Trim_, said my uncle _Toby_, as long as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor lieutenant ----And this, ----said my uncle _Toby_, taking up the sword in his hand, and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spoke----and this, _Le Fever_, I'll save for thee, --'tis all the fortune, continued my uncle _Toby_, hanging it up upon a crook, and pointing to it, --'tis all the fortune, my dear _Le Fever_, which God has left thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world, --and thou doest it like a man of honour, --'tis enough for us.\nAs soon as my uncle _Toby_ had laid a foundation, and taught him to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him to a public school, where, excepting _Whitsontide_ and _Christmas_, at which times the corporal was punctually dispatched for him, --he remained to the spring of the year, seventeen; when the stories of the emperor's sending his army into _Hungary_ against the _Turks_, kindling a spark of fire in his bosom, he left his _Greek_ and _Latin_ without leave, and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle _Toby_, begged his father's sword, and my uncle _Toby's_ leave along with it, to go and try his fortune under _Eugene_. --Twice did my uncle _Toby_ forget his wound and cry out, _Le Fever!_ I will go with thee, and thou shalt fight beside me ----And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and hung down his head in sorrow and disconsolation.----\nMy uncle _Toby_ took down the sword from the crook, where it had hung untouched ever since the lieutenant's death, and delivered it to the corporal to brighten up; ----and having detained _Le Fever_ a single fortnight to equip him, and contract for his passage to _Leghorn_, --he put the sword into his hand. ----If thou art brave, _Le Fever_, said my uncle _Toby_, this will not fail thee, ----but Fortune, said he (musing a little), ----Fortune may ----And if she does, --added my uncle _Toby_, embracing him, come back again to me, _Le Fever_, and we will shape thee another course.\nThe greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of _Le Fever_ more than my uncle _Toby's_ paternal kindness; ----he parted from my uncle _Toby_, as the best of sons from the best of fathers----both dropped tears----and as my uncle _Toby_ gave him his last kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into his hand,---- and bid God bless him.",

        "text": "When my uncle Toby had turned Le Fever's belongings into money and settled all his accounts, there was nothing left but an old regimental coat and a sword. The coat my uncle gave to the corporal.\n'Wear it, Trim,' said he, 'for the sake of the poor lieutenant. - And this' - my uncle Toby drew the sword out of the scabbard as he spoke - 'this, young Le Fever, I'll save for thee. 'Tis all the fortune which God has left thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with - and thou doest it like a man of honour - 'tis enough for us.'\nAs soon as my uncle Toby had laid a foundation, and taught the boy to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him to a public school, where - except Whitsuntide and Christmas, when the corporal went to fetch him home - he remained until the spring of 1717. Then, fired by stories of the emperor's sending his army into Hungary against the Turks, he left his Greek and Latin without leave; and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle, begged his father's sword, and my uncle's permission to go and try his fortune as a soldier.\nTwice did my uncle Toby forget his wound and cry out, 'Le Fever! I will go with thee, and thou shalt fight beside me.' - And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and hung his head in sorrow.\nMy uncle Toby kept Le Fever a fortnight to equip him, and buy his passage to Leghorn. Then he took down the sword from where it had hung since the lieutenant's death, and put it into his hand.\n'If thou art brave, Le Fever,' said he, 'this will not fail thee; but' (musing a little), 'Fortune may. If she does, come back again to me, Le Fever,' said he, embracing him, 'and we will shape thee another course.'\nThe greatest injury could not have affected Le Fever more than my uncle Toby's kindness; he parted from my uncle as the best of sons from the best of fathers - both dropped tears - and as my uncle Toby gave him his last kiss, he slipped him sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his father's, along with his mother's ring; - and bid God bless him.",
