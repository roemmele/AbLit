        "text": "Now, because I have once or twice said, in my inconsiderate way of talking, That I was confident the following memoirs of my uncle _Toby's_ courtship of widow _Wadman_, whenever I got time to write them, would turn out one of the most complete systems, both of the elementary and practical part of love and love-making, that ever was addressed to the world----are you to imagine from thence, that I shall set out with a description of _what love is?_ whether part God and part Devil, as _Plotinus_ will have it----\n----Or by a more critical equation, and supposing the whole of love to be as ten----to determine with _Ficinus_, \"_How many parts of it--the one, --and how many the other_;\" --or whether it is _all of it one great Devil_, from head to tail, as _Plato_ has taken upon him to pronounce; concerning which conceit of his, I shall not offer my opinion: --but my opinion of _Plato_ is this; that he appears, from this instance, to have been a man of much the same temper and way of reasoning with doctor _Baynyard_, who being a great enemy to blisters, as imagining that half a dozen of 'em at once, would draw a man as surely to his grave, as a herse and six--rashly concluded, that the Devil himself was nothing in the world, but one great bouncing _Canthari[di]s_.------\nI have nothing to say to people who allow themselves this monstrous liberty in arguing, but what _Nazianzen_ cried out (_that is, polemically_) to _Philagrius_----\n\"!\" _O rare! 'tis fine reasoning, Sir, indeed!_-- \" \"--_and most nobly do you aim at truth, when you philosophize about it in your moods and passions._\nNor is it to be imagined, for the same reason, I should stop to inquire, whether love is a disease, ----or embroil myself with _Rhasis_ and _Dioscorides_, whether the seat of it is in the brain or liver; --because this would lead me on, to an examination of the two very opposite manners, in which patients have been treated----the one, of _Atius_, who always begun with a cooling clyster of hempseed and bruised cucumbers; --and followed on with thin potations of water-lillies and purslane--to which he added a pinch of snuff of the herb _Hanea_; --and where _Atius_ durst venture it, --his topaz-ring.\n----The other, that of _Gordonius_, who (in his cap. 15. _de Amore_) directs they should be thrashed, \"_ad putorem usque_,\" ----till they stink again.\nThese are disquisitions, which my father, who had laid in a great stock of knowledge of this kind, will be very busy with in the progress of my uncle _Toby's_ affairs: I must anticipate thus much, That from his theories of love, (with which, by the way, he contrived to crucify my uncle _Toby's_ mind, almost as much as his amours themselves)--he took a single step into practice; --and by means of a camphorated cerecloth, which he found means to impose upon the taylor for buckram, whilst he was making my uncle _Toby_ a new pair of breeches, he produced _Gordonius's_ effect upon my uncle _Toby_ without the disgrace.\nWhat changes this produced, will be read in its proper place: all that is needful to be added to the anecdote, is this ----That whatever effect it had upon my uncle _Toby_, ----it had a vile effect upon the house; ----and if my uncle _Toby_ had not smoaked it down as he did, it might have had a vile effect upon my father too.",
