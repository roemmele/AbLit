        "text": "There is nothing that shows the character of my father and my uncle Toby in a more entertaining light, than their different manner under the same accident of love. I do not call love a misfortune, but am persuaded that a man's heart is the better for it.\nGreat God! what must my uncle Toby's heart have been with love, when 'twas all benignity without it.\nMy father, as appears from many of his papers, was very subject to this passion before he married - but from a little subacid kind of drollish impatience in his nature, whenever love befell him, he would never submit to it, but would pish, and huff, and bounce, and kick, and play the Devil, and write the bitterest verses that ever man wrote. There is one verse upon somebody's eye that for two or three nights kept him from his rest; which begins thus:\n'A Devil 'tis - and mischief such doth work\nAs never yet did Pagan, Jew, or Turk.'\nIn short, when in love, my father was all abuse and foul language, cursing this and that and everything under heaven which aided or abetted his love - yet he cursed himself into the bargain, as one of the most egregious fools that ever was let loose in the world.\nMy uncle Toby, on the contrary, took it like a lamb - sat still and let the poison work in his veins without resistance. In the sharpest pains of the wound (like that on his groin) he never dropped one fretful word - he blamed neither heaven nor earth, or spoke ill of any body. He sat solitary and pensive with his pipe - looking at his lame leg - then whiffing out a sentimental heigh ho! mixed with the smoke.\nHe took it like a lamb, I say.\nIn truth he had mistook it at first; for having taken a ride with my father that morning, to save if possible a beautiful wood which the dean and chapter were hewing down to give to the poor; and which was in full view of my uncle Toby's house, and of singular service to him in his description of the battle of Wynnendale - by trotting on too hastily to save it, upon an uneasy saddle - it so happened, that a blister formed in the nethermost part of my uncle Toby - the first shootings of which (as he had no experience of love) he had taken for a part of the passion - till the blister breaking in the one case - and the other remaining - my uncle Toby was convinced that his wound was not skin-deep, but that it had gone to his heart.",
