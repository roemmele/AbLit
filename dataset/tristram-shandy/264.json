It then came into my head, that I should fall in love. - I blushed when I saw how white a hand she had - I shall never see another hand so white whilst I live.'\n'Not in that place,' said my uncle Toby.\nThough he was serious, the corporal could not help smiling.\n'The young Beguine,' he continued, 'seeing the rubbing helped me greatly, proceeded to rub with three fingers - till by little and little she brought down the fourth, and rubbed with her whole hand: I will never say another word upon hands again - but it was softer than satin-'\n'Prithee, Trim, commend it as much as thou wilt,' said my uncle Toby; 'I shall hear thy story with the more delight.'\nThe corporal thanked his master.\n'The fair Beguine,' said he, 'continued rubbing with her whole hand under my knee, till I feared her zeal would weary her. \"I would do a thousand times more,\" said she, \"for the love of Christ\" - In saying which, she moved her hand to the part above my knee, and rubbed it also.\n'I perceived, then, I was beginning to be in love-\n'As she continued rub-rub-rubbing - I felt it spread from under her hand, your honour, to every part of my frame.\n'The more she rubbed, and the longer strokes she took - the more the fire kindled in my veins - till at length, by two or three strokes longer than the rest - my passion rose to the highest pitch - I seized her hand-'\n'- And then thou clapped it to thy lips, Trim,' said my uncle Toby, 'and made a speech.'\nWhether the corporal's amour ended precisely in that way, is not important; it is enough that it contained the essence of all the love romances which have ever been wrote since the beginning of the world.",
