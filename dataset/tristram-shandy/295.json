I suppose so--said my uncle _Toby_: and therefore when a person, continued Mrs. _Wadman_, is so much at his ease as you are--so happy, captain _Shandy_, in yourself, your friends and your amusements --I wonder, what reasons can incline you to the state------\n----They are written, quoth my uncle _Toby_, in the Common-Prayer Book.\nThus far my uncle _Toby_ went on warily, and kept within his depth, leaving Mrs. _Wadman_ to sail upon the gulph as she pleased.\n----As for children--said Mrs. _Wadman_--though a principal end perhaps of the institution, and the natural wish, I suppose, of every parent--yet do not we all find, they are certain sorrows, and very uncertain comforts? and what is there, dear sir, to pay one for the heart-aches--what compensation for the many tender and disquieting apprehensions of a suffering and defenceless mother who brings them into life? I declare, said my uncle _Toby_, smit with pity, I know of none; unless it be the pleasure which it has pleased God----\nA fiddlestick! quoth she.",
