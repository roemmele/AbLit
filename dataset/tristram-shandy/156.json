        "text": "The city of _Limerick_, the siege of which was begun under his majesty king _William_ himself, the year after I went into the army--lies, an' please your honours, in the middle of a devilish wet, swampy country. --'Tis quite surrounded, said my uncle _Toby_, with the _Shannon_, and is, by its situation, one of the strongest fortified places in _Ireland_.----\nI think this is a new fashion, quoth Dr. _Slop_, of beginning a medical lecture. --'Tis all true, answered _Trim_. --Then I wish the faculty would follow the cut of it, said _Yorick_. --'Tis all cut through, an' please your reverence, said the corporal, with drains and bogs; and besides, there was such a quantity of rain fell during the siege, the whole country was like a puddle, --'twas that, and nothing else, which brought on the flux, and which had like to have killed both his honour and myself; now there was no such thing, after the first ten days, continued the corporal, for a soldier to lie dry in his tent, without cutting a ditch round it, to draw off the water; --nor was that enough, for those who could afford it, as his honour could, without setting fire every night to a pewter dish full of brandy, which took off the damp of the air, and made the inside of the tent as warm as a stove.------\nAnd what conclusion dost thou draw, corporal _Trim_, cried my father, from all these premises?\nI infer, an' please your worship, replied _Trim_, that the radical moisture is nothing in the world but ditch-water--and that the radical heat, of those who can go to the expence of it, is burnt brandy, --the radical heat and moisture of a private man, an' please your honour, is nothing but ditch-water--and a dram of geneva----and give us but enough of it, with a pipe of tobacco, to give us spirits, and drive away the vapours--we know not what it is to fear death.\nI am at a loss, Captain _Shandy_, quoth Dr. _Slop_, to determine in which branch of learning your servant shines most, whether in physiology or divinity. --_Slop_ had not forgot _Trim's_ comment upon the sermon.--\nIt is but an hour ago, replied _Yorick_, since the corporal was examined in the latter, and pass'd muster with great honour.----\nThe radical heat and moisture, quoth Dr. _Slop_, turning to my father, you must know, is the basis and foundation of our being--as the root of a tree is the source and principle of its vegetation. --It is inherent in the seeds of all animals, and may be preserved sundry ways, but principally in my opinion by _consubstantials_, _impriments_, and _occludents_. ----Now this poor fellow, continued Dr. _Slop_, pointing to the corporal, has had the misfortune to have heard some superficial empiric discourse upon this nice point. ----That he has, --said my father. ----Very likely, said my uncle. --I'm sure of it--quoth _Yorick_.----",

A soldier could not lie dry in his tent, without cutting a ditch round it, to draw off the water; and those who could afford it, as his honour could, set fire every night to a dish full of brandy, which took off the damp of the air, and made the inside of the tent as warm as a stove.'\n'And what conclusion dost thou draw,' cried my father, 'from all this?'\n'I infer, an' please your worship,' replied Trim, 'that the radical moisture is nothing but ditch-water - and that the radical heat, of those who can afford it, is burnt brandy; - for a private soldier, 'tis nothing but ditch-water and a dram of gin - and give us but enough of it, with a pipe of tobacco, to drive away the vapours - we know not what it is to fear death.'\n'I am at a loss, Captain Shandy,' quoth Dr. Slop, 'to decide whether your servant shines most in physiology or divinity.' Slop had not forgot Trim's comment on the sermon.\n'Only an hour ago,' replied Yorick, 'the corporal was examined in the latter, and passed with great honour.'\n'The radical heat and moisture,' quoth Dr. Slop, turning to my father, 'you must know, is the foundation of our being. - It is inherent in the seeds of all animals, and may be preserved in many ways, but principally in my opinion by consubstantials, impriments, and occludents. Now this poor fellow,' continued Dr. Slop, pointing to the corporal, 'has heard some superficial talk upon this delicate point.'\n'That he has,' said my father.\n'Very likely,' said my uncle.\n'I'm sure of it,' quoth Yorick.",
