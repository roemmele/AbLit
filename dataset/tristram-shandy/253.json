I cry, taking off my furr'd cap, and twisting it round my finger ----I would not give sixpence for a dozen such!\n----But 'tis an excellent cap too (putting it upon my head, and pressing it close to my ears)--and warm--and soft; especially if you stroke it the right way--but alas! that will never be my luck----(so here my philosophy is shipwreck'd again).\n----No; I shall never have a finger in the pye (so here I break my metaphor)----\nCrust and Crumb\nInside and out\nTop and bottom ----I detest it, I hate it, I repudiate it ----I'm sick at the sight of it----\n'Tis all pepper, garlick, staragen, salt, and devil's dung----by the great arch-cook of cooks, who does nothing, I think, from morning to night, but sit down by the fire-side and invent inflammatory dishes for us, I would not touch it for the world----\n----_O Tristram! Tristram!_ cried _Jenny_.\n_O Jenny! Jenny!_ replied I, and so went on with the twelfth chapter.",

I cry, taking off my furred cap, and twisting it round my finger. 'I would not give sixpence for a dozen such!\n'But 'tis an excellent cap (putting it upon my head,) - and warm, and soft; especially if you stroke it the right way - but alas! that will never be my luck.\n'No; I shall never have a finger in the pie' (so here I break my metaphor)-\n'Crust and Crumb\n'Inside and out\n'Top and bottom - I detest it, I hate it, I'm sick at the sight of it-\n''Tis all pepper,\ngarlic,\nsalt, and\ndevil's dung - I would not touch it for the world-'\n'O Tristram! Tristram!' cried Jenny.\n'O Jenny! Jenny!' replied I, and so went on with the twelfth chapter.",
