Your majesty is deceived, replied the minister ----I have this hour received a dispatch from our resident, with the determination of the republick on that point also. ----And what name has the republick fixed upon for the Dauphin? ----_Shadrach_, _Meshech_, _Abed-nego_, replied the minister. --By Saint _Peter's_ girdle, I will have nothing to do with the _Swiss_, cried _Francis_ the First, pulling up his breeches and walking hastily across the floor.\nYour majesty, replied the minister calmly, cannot bring yourself off.\nWe'll pay them in money------said the king.\nSire, there are not sixty thousand crowns in the treasury, answered the minister. ----I'll pawn the best jewel in my crown, quoth _Francis_ the First.\nYour honour stands pawn'd already in this matter, answered Monsieur _le Premier_.\nThen, Mons. _le Premier_, said the king, by------we'll go to war with 'em.\n[Footnote 4.9: Vide Menagiana, Vol. I.]",

'There are more ways of bribing states than giving money. I'll pay Switzerland the honour of being godfather to my next child.'\n'Your majesty,' said the minister, 'you'd have all the grammarians in Europe upon your back; Switzerland, as a republic, being female, cannot be a godfather.'\n'She may be godmother,' replied Francis - 'so announce my intentions by a courier tomorrow.'\n'I am astonished,' said Francis a fortnight later, to his minister, 'that we have had no answer from Switzerland.'\n'Sire, I have this moment brought you their reply.'\n'They take it kindly?' said the king.\n'They do, Sire, and have the highest sense of the honour your majesty has done them - but the republic, as godmother, claims her right of naming the child.'\n'Probably,' quoth the king, 'she will christen him Francis, or Henry, or some name that she knows will be agreeable to us.'\n'Your majesty is deceived,' replied the minister. 'I have received a message from our ambassador, with the republic's decision on that point.'\n'And what name has the republic fixed upon for the prince?'\n'Shadrach, Meshech, Abed-nego,' replied the minister.\n'By Saint Peter's girdle, I will have nothing to do with the Swiss,' cried Francis. 'We'll pay them off.'\n'Sire, there are not sixty thousand crowns in the treasury.'\n'I'll pawn the best jewel in my crown,' quoth Francis.\n'Your honour stands pawned already in this matter.'\n'Then, Monsieur,' said the king, 'by ___, we'll go to war with 'em.'",
