Take pen and ink in hand, brother _Toby_, and calculate it fairly ----I know no more of calculation than this balluster, said my uncle _Toby_ (striking short of it with his crutch, and hitting my father a desperate blow souse upon his shin-bone)----'Twas a hundred to one--cried my uncle _Toby_ --I thought, quoth my father (rubbing his shin), you had known nothing of calculations, brother _Toby_. 'Tis a mere chance, said my uncle _Toby_. ------Then it adds one to the chapter----replied my father.\nThe double success of my father's repartees tickled off the pain of his shin at once--it was well it so fell out--(chance! again)--or the world to this day had never known the subject of my father's calculation----to guess it--there was no chance ----What a lucky chapter of chances has this turned out! for it has saved me the trouble of writing one express, and in truth I have enough already upon my hands without it. --Have not I promised the world a chapter of knots? two chapters upon the right and the wrong end of a woman? a chapter upon whiskers? a chapter upon wishes? ----a chapter of noses? --No, I have done that--a chapter upon my uncle _Toby's_ modesty? to say nothing of a chapter upon chapters, which I will finish before I sleep--by my great-grandfather's whiskers, I shall never get half of 'em through this year.\nTake pen and ink in hand, and calculate it fairly, brother _Toby_, said my father, and it will turn out a million to one, that of all the parts of the body, the edge of the forceps should have the ill luck just to fall upon and break down that one part, which should break down the fortunes of our house with it.\nIt might have been worse, replied my uncle _Toby_. ----I don't comprehend, said my father. ------Suppose the hip had presented, replied my uncle _Toby_, as Dr. _Slop_ foreboded.\nMy father reflected half a minute--looked down----touched the middle of his forehead slightly with his finger------\n--True, said he.",

Take pen in hand, brother Toby, and calculate it.'\n'I know no more of calculation than this banister,' said my uncle Toby (attempting to strike it with his crutch, and hitting my father a blow upon his shin-bone). ''Twas a hundred to one chance,' cried my uncle.\n'I thought,' quoth my father (rubbing his shin), 'you knew nothing of calculations, brother.'\nThe success of my father's repartee tickled off the pain of his shin. It was well it happened (chance! again) - or the world would never have known the subject of my father's calculation - there was no chance of guessing it-\nWhat a lucky chapter of chances has this turned out! for it has saved me the trouble of writing one especially, and in truth I have enough already upon my hands without it. Have I not promised the world a chapter of knots? two chapters upon the right and wrong end of a woman? a chapter upon whiskers? a chapter upon wishes? a chapter of noses? No, I have done that. A chapter upon my uncle Toby's modesty? to say nothing of a chapter upon chapters, which I will finish before I sleep. By my great-grandfather's whiskers, I shall never get through half of 'em this year.\n'Take pen in hand, and calculate it,' said my father, 'and it will turn out a million to one, that of all the parts of the body, the forceps should have the ill luck just to break that part, which should destroy the fortunes of our house with it.'\n'It might have been worse,' replied my uncle Toby. 'Suppose the hip had presented, as Dr. Slop foreboded.'\nMy father reflected half a minute-\n'True,' said he.",
