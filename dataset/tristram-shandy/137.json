What signified his marching the horse, continued the corporal, where the ground was so straight, that the _French_ had such a nation of hedges, and copses, and ditches, and fell'd trees laid this way and that to cover them; (as they always have). ----Count _Solmes_ should have sent us, ----we would have fired muzzle to muzzle with them for their lives. ----There was nothing to be done for the horse: ----he had his foot shot off however for his pains, continued the corporal, the very next campaign at _Landen_. --Poor _Trim_ got his wound there, quoth my uncle _Toby_. ----'Twas owing, an' please your honour, entirely to count _Solmes_, ----had he drubb'd them soundly at _Steenkirk_, they would not have fought us at _Landen_. ----Possibly not, ----_Trim_, said my uncle _Toby_; ----though if they have the advantage of a wood, or you give them a moment's time to intrench themselves, they are a nation which will pop and pop for ever at you. ----There is no way but to march coolly up to them, ----receive their fire, and fall in upon them, pell-mell ----Ding dong, added _Trim_. ----Horse and foot, said my uncle _Toby_. ----Helter skelter, said _Trim_. ----Right and left, cried my uncle _Toby_. ----Blood an' ounds, shouted the corporal; ----the battle raged, ----_Yorick_ drew his chair a little to one side for safety, and after a moment's pause, my uncle _Toby_ sinking his voice a note, --resumed the discourse as follows.",

He had his foot shot off however for his pains, the very next campaign at Landen.'\n'Poor Trim got his wound there,' quoth my uncle Toby.\n''Twas owing, your honour, entirely to Count Solmes - had he drubbed them soundly at Steenkirk, they would not have fought us at Landen.'\n'Possibly not, Trim,' said my uncle Toby; 'though if you give them a moment's time to entrench themselves, they are a nation which will pop and pop for ever at you. There is no way but to march coolly up to them, - receive their fire, and fall upon them, pell-mell.'\n'Ding dong,' added Trim.\n'Horse and foot,' said my uncle.\n'Helter skelter,' said Trim.\n'Right and left,' cried my uncle Toby.\n'Blood an' ounds,' shouted the corporal. The battle raged; Yorick drew his chair to one side for safety, and after a moment, my uncle Toby, sinking his voice, resumed as follows.",
