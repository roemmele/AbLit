        "text": "_O Slawkenbergius!_ thou faithful analyzer of my _Disgrazias_--thou sad foreteller of so many of the whips and short turns which in one stage or other of my life have come slap upon me from the shortness of my nose, and no other cause, that I am conscious of. --Tell me, _Slawkenbergius!_ what secret impulse was it? what intonation of voice? whence came it? how did it sound in thy ears? ----art thou sure thou heard'st it? ----which first cried out to thee------go------go, _Slawkenbergius!_ dedicate the labours of thy life----neglect thy pastimes------call forth all the powers and faculties of thy nature----macerate thyself in the service of mankind, and write a grand FOLIO for them, upon the subject of their noses.\nHow the communication was conveyed into _Slawkenbergius's_ sensorium----so that _Slawkenbergius_ should know whose finger touch'd the key--and whose hand it was that blew the bellows----as _Hafen Slawkenbergius_ has been dead and laid in his grave above fourscore and ten years------we can only raise conjectures.\n_Slawkenbergius_ was play'd upon, for aught I know, like one of _Whitefield's_ disciples----that is, with such a distinct intelligence, Sir, of which of the two _masters_ it was that had been practising upon his _instrument_------as to make all reasoning upon it needless.\n------For in the account which _Hafen Slawkenbergius_ gives the world of his motives and occasions for writing, and spending so many years of his life upon this one work--towards the end of his prolegomena, which by the bye should have come first----but the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it betwixt the analytical contents of the book, and the book itself--he informs his reader, that ever since he had arrived at the age of discernment, and was able to sit down coolly, and consider within himself the true state and condition of man, and distinguish the main end and design of his being; ----or--to shorten my translation, for _Slawkenbergius's_ book is in _Latin_, and not a little prolix in this passage--ever since I understood, quoth _Slawkenbergius_, any thing----or rather _what was what_----and could perceive that the point of long noses had been too loosely handled by all who had gone before; ----have I, _Slawkenbergius_, felt a strong impulse, with a mighty and unresistible call within me, to gird up myself to this undertaking.\nAnd to do justice to _Slawkenbergius_, he has entered the list with a stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it than any one man who had ever entered it before him----and indeed, in many respects, deserves to be _en-nich'd_ as a prototype for all writers, of voluminous works at least, to model their books by----for he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject--examined every part of it _dialectically_------then brought it into full day; dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of his own natural parts could strike--or the profoundest knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon it--collating, collecting, and compiling------begging, borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos of the learned: so that _Slawkenbergius_ his book may properly be considered, not only as a model--but as a thorough-stitched DIGEST and regular institute of _noses_, comprehending in it all that is or can be needful to be known about them.\nFor this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many (otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father's collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses----or collaterally touching them; ------such for instance as _Prignitz_, now lying upon the table before me, who with infinite learning, and from the most candid and scholar-like examination of above four thousand different skulls, in upwards of twenty charnel-houses in _Silesia_, which he had rummaged------has informed us, that the mensuration and configuration of the osseous or bony parts of human noses, in any _given_ tract of country, except _Crim Tartary_, where they are all crush'd down by the thumb, so that no judgment can be formed upon them--are much nearer alike, than the world imagines; --the difference amongst them being, he says, a mere trifle, not worth taking notice of; ----but that the size and jollity of every individual nose, and by which one nose ranks above another, and bears a higher price, is owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it, into whose ducts and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell'd and driven by the warmth and force of the imagination, which is but a step from it (bating the case of idiots, whom _Prignitz_, who had lived many years in _Turky_, supposes under the more immediate tutelage of Heaven)--it so happens, and ever must, says _Prignitz_, that the excellency of the nose is in a direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the wearer's fancy.\nIt is for the same reason, that is, because 'tis all comprehended in _Slawkenbergius_, that I say nothing likewise of _Scroderus_ (_Andrea_) who, all the world knows, set himself to oppugn _Prignitz_ with great violence--proving it in his own way, first _logically_, and then by a series of stubborn facts, \"That so far was _Prignitz_ from the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat the nose, that on the contrary--the nose begat the fancy.\"\n--The learned suspected _Scroderus_ of an indecent sophism in this--and _Prignitz_ cried out aloud in the dispute, that _Scroderus_ had shifted the idea upon him----but _Scroderus_ went on, maintaining his thesis.\nMy father was just balancing within himself, which of the two sides he should take in this affair; when _Ambrose Parus_ decided it in a moment, and by overthrowing the systems, both of _Prignitz_ and _Scroderus_, drove my father out of both sides of the controversy at once.\nBe witness------\nI don't acquaint the learned reader--in saying it, I mention it only to shew the learned, I know the fact myself------\nThat this _Ambrose Parus_ was chief surgeon and nose-mender to _Francis_ the ninth of _France_, and in high credit with him and the two preceding, or succeeding kings (I know not which)--and that, except in the slip he made in his story of _Taliacotius's_ noses, and his manner of setting them on--he was esteemed by the whole college of physicians at that time, as more knowing in matters of noses, than any one who had ever taken them in hand.\nNow _Ambrose Parus_ convinced my father, that the true and efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention of the world, and upon which _Prignitz_ and _Scroderus_ had wasted so much learning and fine parts----was neither this nor that----but that the length and goodness of the nose was owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the nurse's breast------as the flatness and shortness of _puisne_ noses was to the firmness and elastic repulsion of the same organ of nutrition in the hale and lively--which, tho' happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child, inasmuch as his nose was so snubb'd, so rebuff'd, so rebated, and so refrigerated thereby, as never to arrive _ad mensuram suam legitimam_; ----but that in case of the flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother's breast--by sinking into it, quoth _Parus_, as into so much butter, the nose was comforted, nourish'd, plump'd up, refresh'd, refocillated, and set a growing for ever.\nI have but two things to observe of _Parus_; first, That he proves and explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum of expression: --for which may his soul for ever rest in peace!\nAnd, secondly, that besides the systems of _Prignitz_ and _Scroderus_, which _Ambrose Parus_ his hypothesis effectually overthrew--it overthrew at the same time the system of peace and harmony of our family; and for three days together, not only embroiled matters between my father and my mother, but turn'd likewise the whole house and everything in it, except my uncle _Toby_, quite upside down.\nSuch a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife, never surely in any age or country got vent through the key-hole of a street-door.\nMy mother, you must know------but I have fifty things more necessary to let you know first ----I have a hundred difficulties which I have promised to clear up, and a thousand distresses and domestick misadventures crowding in upon me thick and threefold, one upon the neck of another. A cow broke in (to-morrow morning) to my uncle _Toby's_ fortifications, and eat up two rations and a half of dried grass, tearing up the sods with it, which faced his horn-work and covered way. ----_Trim_ insists upon being tried by a court-martial--the cow to be shot--_Slop_ to be _crucifix'd_--myself to be _tristram'd_ and at my very baptism made a martyr of; ----poor unhappy devils that we all are! ----I want swaddling------but there is no time to be lost in exclamations ------I have left my father lying across his bed, and my uncle _Toby_ in his old fringed chair, sitting beside him, and promised I would go back to them in half an hour; and five-and-thirty minutes are laps'd already. ------Of all the perplexities a mortal author was ever seen in----this certainly is the greatest, for I have _Hafen Slawkenbergius's_ folio, Sir, to finish----a dialogue between my father and my uncle _Toby_, upon the solution of _Prignitz_, _Scroderus_, _Ambrose Parus_, _Ponocrates_, and _Grangousier_ to relate--a tale out of _Slawkenbergius_ to translate, and all this in five minutes less than no time at all; ------such a head! --would to Heaven my enemies only saw the inside of it!",

        "text": "O Slawkenbergius! thou faithful analyzer of my Disgrazias - thou sad foreteller of the misfortunes which have come slap upon me from the shortness of my nose, and no other cause. Tell me, Slawkenbergius! what secret impulse first cried out to thee - 'Go, go, Slawkenbergius! dedicate the labours of thy life and all thy powers to the service of mankind, and write a grand Folio for them, upon the subject of their noses.'\nHow this came to pass - as he has been dead and buried ninety years - we can only guess.\nIn the account which Hafen Slawkenbergius gives the world of his motives for spending so many years writing this one work - towards the end of his prologue, which by the bye should have come first, but the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it betwixt the contents list and the book itself - he informs his reader, that ever since he had arrived at the age of discernment, and was able to sit down coolly, and consider the true state of man - or, to shorten my translation, for Slawkenbergius's book is in Latin, and somewhat prolix - 'ever since I understood what was what,' quoth Slawkenbergius, 'and could see that the point of long noses had been too loosely handled by others, I have felt a mighty and irresistible call to undertake this myself.'\nAnd to do him justice, he deserves to be held up as a prototype for all writers of voluminous works. For he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject - examined every part of it - then brought it into full daylight; elucidating it with his profound knowledge of the sciences - collecting, and compiling - begging, borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, so that his book may be considered a thorough-stitched Digest and regular institute of noses, containing all that needs to be known about them.\nTherefore I will not speak of many (otherwise) valuable books of my father's collection, either wrote plump on noses or touching them - such as Prignitz, now lying upon the table before me, who from the examination of four thousand different skulls, in twenty charnel-houses in Silesia, through which he had rummaged - has informed us, that the shape of the osseous or bony parts of human noses, in every country except Crim Tartary, are much more alike than the world imagines; and that the size and jollity of every individual nose is owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it, into whose ducts the blood and animal spirits are driven by the warmth of the imagination. So, says Prignitz, the excellency of the nose is in direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the wearer's fancy or imagination.\nLikewise, because 'tis all contained in Slawkenbergius, I say nothing of Scroderus who, all the world knows, violently opposed Prignitz - proving 'that on the contrary - the nose begat the fancy.'\nMy father was weighing up which side he should take in this affair; when Ambrose Paraeus decided it by overthrowing both systems.\nI am sure the learned know this: I mention it only to show that I know the fact myself-\nThat this Ambrose Paraeus was chief surgeon and nose-mender to Francis the Ninth of France, and was esteemed by the whole college of physicians, for knowing more about noses than anyone who had ever taken them in hand.\nNow Ambrose Paraeus convinced my father that both Prignitz and Scoderus were wrong; and that the length and goodness of the nose was owing simply to the softness of the nurse's breast; and flat, short noses were due to firmness of the same organ of nutrition in the healthy - which, though happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child, inasmuch as his nose was so snubbed that it would never grow to full measure. But when the mother's breast was soft and flaccid - by sinking into it, quoth Paraeus, as into so much butter, the nose was comforted, nourished, plumped up, and set a-growing for ever.\nI have two things to observe of Paraeus; first, that he explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum: for which may he rest in peace!\nAnd, secondly, that his hypothesis overthrew not only the systems of Prignitz and Scroderus - but also the peace and harmony of our family. For three days, it not only embroiled matters between my father and my mother, but turned the whole house and everything in it, except my uncle Toby, quite upside down.\nSuch a ridiculous dispute between a man and his wife surely never occurred. My mother, you must know-\n- but I have fifty things more necessary to let you know first - I have a hundred difficulties to clear up, and a thousand domestic misadventures crowding in upon me thick and fast. A cow broke in (tomorrow morning) to my uncle Toby's fortifications, and ate the grass which faced his hornwork and covered way. - Trim insists upon a court-martial - the cow to be shot - Slop to be crucifixed - myself to be tristram'd and made a martyr of; - poor unhappy devils that we all are! - I need swaddling - but there is not time to waste - I have left my father lying across his bed, and my uncle Toby sitting in his old chair beside him, and promised I would go back to them in half an hour; and five-and-thirty minutes are lapsed already.\nOf all the perplexities an author was ever in, this certainly is the greatest, for I have Slawkenbergius's folio, Sir, to finish - a dialogue between my father and my uncle Toby, upon the solution of Prignitz, Scroderus and others to relate - a tale out of Slawkenbergius to translate, and all this in five minutes less than no time at all. Such a head! would to Heaven my enemies only saw the inside of it!",
