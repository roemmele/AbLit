The second, third, fourth, and fifth time, I blamed only the second, third, fourth, and fifth post-boys, without reflecting further; but when the event befell me a sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth time, I could not avoid making a national reflection:\nThat something is always wrong in a French post-chaise, upon first setting out.\nOr thus:\nA French postilion always has to alight before he has got three hundred yards out of town.\nWhat's wrong now?\nDiable! - a rope's broke! - a knot has slipped! - a staple's drawn! - a tag, a rag, a jag, a strap, a buckle, wants altering.\nNow, I never swear at the post-chaise, or its driver - but I take the matter coolly, and consider that some tag, rag, jag, strap or buckle will always want altering, wherever I travel. So I take the good and the bad as they fall in my road, and get on.\n'Do so, my lad!' said I; he had lost five minutes already, in alighting to get a luncheon of black bread, which he had crammed into the chaise-pocket, and he had remounted and was going leisurely on, to relish it the better - 'Get on, my lad,' said I, briskly - but in the most persuasive tone imaginable, for I jingled a coin against the glass: the dog grinned from ear to ear, and behind his sooty muzzle uncovered a pearly row of teeth.\nHeaven! What masticators! What bread!\n- and so as he finished his last mouthful, we entered the town of Montreuil.",
