        "text": "It was some time in the summer of that year in which _Dendermond_ was taken by the allies, --which was about seven years before my father came into the country, --and about as many, after the time, that my uncle _Toby_ and _Trim_ had privately decamped from my father's house in town, in order to lay some of the finest sieges to some of the finest fortified cities in _Europe_----when my uncle _Toby_ was one evening getting his supper, with _Trim_ sitting behind him at a small sideboard, --I say, sitting--for in consideration of the corporal's lame knee (which sometimes gave him exquisite pain)--when my uncle _Toby_ dined or supped alone, he would never suffer the corporal to stand; and the poor fellow's veneration for his master was such, that, with a proper artillery, my uncle _Toby_ could have taken _Dendermond_ itself, with less trouble than he was able to gain this point over him; for many a time when my uncle _Toby_ supposed the corporal's leg was at rest, he would look back, and detect him standing behind him with the most dutiful respect: this bred more little squabbles betwixt them, than all other causes for five-and-twenty years together --But this is neither here nor there--why do I mention it? ----Ask my pen, --it governs me, --I govern not it.\nHe was one evening sitting thus at his supper, when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour, with an empty phial in his hand, to beg a glass or two of sack; 'Tis for a poor gentleman, --I think, of the army, said the landlord, who has been taken ill at my house four days ago, and has never held up his head since, or had a desire to taste anything, till just now, that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast, ----_I think_, says he, taking his hand from his forehead, _it would comfort me_.\n----If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy such a thing--added the landlord, --I would almost steal it for the poor gentleman, he is so ill. ----I hope in God he will still mend, continued he, --we are all of us concerned for him.\nThou art a good-natured soul, I will answer for thee, cried my uncle _Toby_; and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glass of sack thyself, --and take a couple of bottles with my service, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.\nThough I am persuaded, said my uncle _Toby_, as the landlord shut the door, he is a very compassionate fellow--_Trim_, --yet I cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his guest too; there must be something more than common in him, that in so short a time should win so much upon the affections of his host; ----And of his whole family, added the corporal, for they are all concerned for him. ----Step after him, said my uncle _Toby_, --do, _Trim_, --and ask if he knows his name.\n----I have quite forgot it truly, said the landlord, coming back into the parlour with the corporal, --but I can ask his son again: ----Has he a son with him then? said my uncle _Toby_. --A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of age; --but the poor creature has tasted almost as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day: ----He has not stirred from the bed-side these two days.\nMy uncle _Toby_ laid down his knife and fork, and thrust his plate from before him, as the landlord gave him the account; and _Trim_, without being ordered, took away, without saying one word, and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco.\n----Stay in the room a little, said my uncle _Toby_.\n_Trim!_----said my uncle _Toby_, after he lighted his pipe, and smoak'd about a dozen whiffs. ----_Trim_ came in front of his master, and made his bow; --my uncle _Toby_ smoak'd on, and said no more. ----Corporal! said my uncle _Toby_----the corporal made his bow. ----My uncle _Toby_ proceeded no farther, but finished his pipe.\n_Trim!_ said my uncle _Toby_, I have a project in my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure, and paying a visit to this poor gentleman. ----Your honour's roquelaure, replied the corporal, has not once been had on, since the night before your honour received your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St. _Nicolas_; ----and besides, it is so cold and rainy a night, that what with the roquelaure, and what with the weather, 'twill be enough to give your honour your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your groin. I fear so, replied my uncle _Toby_; but I am not at rest in my mind, _Trim_, since the account the landlord has given me. ----I wish I had not known so much of this affair, --added my uncle _Toby_, --or that I had known more of it: ----How shall we manage it? Leave it, an't please your honour, to me, quoth the corporal; ----I'll take my hat and stick and go to the house and reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring your honour a full account in an hour. ----Thou shalt go, _Trim_, said my uncle _Toby_, and here's a shilling for thee to drink with his servant. ----I shall get it all out of him, said the corporal, shutting the door.\nMy uncle _Toby_ filled his second pipe; and had it not been, that he now and then wandered from the point, with considering whether it was not full as well to have the curtain of the tenaille a straight line, as a crooked one, --he might be said to have thought of nothing else but poor _Le Fever_ and his boy the whole time he smoaked it.",

        "text": "It was in the summer of that year in which Dendermond was taken by the allies, which was about seven years after my uncle Toby and Trim had gone into the country to lay siege upon the bowling-green to some of the finest fortified cities in Europe.\nMy uncle Toby was one evening at home having his supper, with Trim sitting behind him - for in consideration of the corporal's lame and painful knee, when my uncle Toby dined, he would never allow the corporal to stand; and the poor fellow's veneration for his master was such that my uncle Toby had some trouble in maintaining this point; for often he would look back and see the corporal standing behind him with the most dutiful respect: this bred more little squabbles betwixt them, than all other causes in five-and-twenty years-\nBut this is neither here nor there. Why do I mention it? Ask my pen, it governs me - I govern not it.\nHe was one evening sitting thus at his supper, when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour, with an empty phial in his hand, to beg a glass of sherry.\n''Tis for a poor gentleman - I think, of the army,' said the landlord, 'who was taken ill at my house four days ago, and has had no desire to taste anything, till just now, when he took a fancy for a glass of sherry and thin toast. If I could not beg it, I would almost steal it for the poor gentleman, he is so ill. We are all of us concerned for him.'\n'Thou art a good-natured soul,' cried my uncle Toby; 'and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glass thyself: take a couple of bottles, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.'\nAs the landlord shut the door, my uncle said to Trim: 'I am sure he is a very compassionate fellow, Trim - yet I cannot help thinking that there must be something uncommon in his guest, too, to make the landlord and his family care so much for him. Step after him, Trim, do; and ask if he knows his name.'\n'I have quite forgot it, truly,' said the landlord, on returning with the corporal, 'but I can ask his son. He has a boy of eleven or twelve years of age; - but the poor creature has eaten as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn for him, and has not stirred from the bedside these two days.'\nMy uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork, and thrust his plate away. Trim brought him his pipe and tobacco.\n'Stay a little,' said my uncle Toby, lighting his pipe. After he had smoked about a dozen whiffs, he said,\n'Trim! As it is a bad night, I am thinking of wrapping myself up in my cloak, and paying a visit to this poor gentleman.'\n'Your honour has not worn your cloak,' replied the corporal, 'since the night before your honour received your wound; and it is so cold and rainy a night, that even with the cloak, 'twill bring on your honour's torment in your groin.'\n'I fear so,' replied my uncle Toby; 'but I am not at rest in my mind, Trim, since the landlord's account.'\n'Leave it to me, your honour,' quoth the corporal. 'I'll go to the house and reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring your honour a full account in an hour.'\n'Go, Trim,' said my uncle; 'here's a shilling for thee to drink with his servant.'\n'I shall get it all out of him,' said the corporal, shutting the door.\nMy uncle Toby filled his second pipe; and apart from wondering whether a fortified outwork was as well in a straight line, as a crooked one, - he might be said to have thought of nothing but poor Le Fever and his boy the whole time he smoked it.",
