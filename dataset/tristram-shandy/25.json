        "text": "I have begun a new book, on purpose that I might have room enough to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle _Toby_ was involved, from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of _Namur_, where he received his wound.\nI must remind the reader, in case he has read the history of King _William's_ wars, --but if he has not, --I then inform him, that one of the most memorable attacks in that siege, was that which was made by the _English_ and _Dutch_ upon the point of the advanced counterscarp, between the gate of _St. Nicolas_, which inclosed the great sluice or water-stop, where the _English_ were terribly exposed to the shot of the counter-guard and demi-bastion of _St. Roch_. The issue of which hot dispute, in three words, was this; That the _Dutch_ lodged themselves upon the counter-guard, --and that the _English_ made themselves masters of the covered-way before _St. Nicolas_-gate, notwithstanding the gallantry of the _French_ officers, who exposed themselves upon the glacis sword in hand.\nAs this was the principal attack of which my uncle _Toby_ was an eye-witness at _Namur_, ----the army of the besiegers being cut off, by the confluence of the _Maes_ and _Sambre_, from seeing much of each other's operations, ----my uncle _Toby_ was generally more eloquent and particular in his account of it; and the many perplexities he was in, arose out of the almost insurmountable difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly, and giving such clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the scarp and counter-scarp, --the glacis and covered-way, --the half-moon and ravelin, --as to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about.\nWriters themselves are too apt to confound these terms; so that you will the less wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and in opposition to many misconceptions, that my uncle _Toby_ did oft-times puzzle his visitors, and sometimes himself too.\nTo speak the truth, unless the company my father led upstairs were tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle _Toby_ was in one of his explanatory moods, 'twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to keep the discourse free from obscurity.\nWhat rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle _Toby_, was this, --that in the attack of the counterscarp, before the gate of _St. Nicolas_, extending itself from the bank of the _Maes_, quite up to the great water-stop, --the ground was cut and cross cut with such a multitude of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all sides, --and he would get so sadly bewildered, and set fast amongst them, that frequently he could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life; and was oft-times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only.\nThese perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle _Toby Shandy_ more perturbations than you would imagine: and as my father's kindness to him was continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh enquirers, ----he had but a very uneasy task of it.\nNo doubt my uncle _Toby_ had great command of himself, could guard appearances, I believe, as well as most men; --yet any one may imagine, that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into the half-moon, or get out of the covered-way without falling down the counterscarp, nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch, but that he must have fretted and fumed inwardly: --He did so; and the little and hourly vexations, which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who has not read _Hippocrates_, yet, whoever has read _Hippocrates_, or Dr. _James Mackenzie_, and has considered well the effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon the digestion--(Why not of a wound as well as of a dinner?)--may easily conceive what sharp paroxysms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle _Toby_ must have undergone upon that score only.\n--My uncle _Toby_ could not philosophize upon it; --'twas enough he felt it was so, --and having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months together, he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself.\nHe was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the anguish and nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no other position, when a thought came into his head, that if he could purchase such a thing, and have it pasted down upon a board, as a large map of the fortification of the town and citadel of _Namur_, with its environs, it might be a means of giving him ease. --I take notice of his desire to have the environs along with the town and citadel, for this reason, --because my uncle _Toby's_ wound was got in one of the traverses, about thirty toises from the returning angle of the trench, opposite to the salient angle of the demi-bastion of _St. Roch_: ----so that he was pretty confident he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing on when the stone struck him.\nAll this succeeded to his wishes, and not only freed him from a world of sad explanations, but, in the end, it proved the happy means, as you will read, of procuring my uncle _Toby_ his HOBBY-HORSE.",

        "text": "I have begun a new book, so that I might have room enough to explain the perplexities in which my uncle Toby was involved, from the many questions about the siege of Namur, where he received his wound.\nI must remind the reader, if he has read the history of King William's wars, that one of the most memorable attacks in that siege was made by the English and Dutch upon the point of the counterscarp, at the gate of St. Nicolas, which enclosed the great sluice where the English were terribly exposed to the shot of the counter-guard of St. Roch. The result of that dispute, in three words, was this: that the Dutch lodged themselves upon the counter-guard, and that the English held the covered-way before St. Nicolas-gate, notwithstanding the gallantry of the French officers on the glacis.\nAs my uncle Toby was an eye-witness at Namur, he was generally eloquent in his account of it; and the many perplexities he was in, arose out of the difficulties he found in making clear the differences between the scarp and counter-scarp, the glacis and covered-way, and the half-moon and ravelin, so that his company would fully comprehend where and what he was about.\nIn trying to explain these terms, my uncle Toby did oft-times puzzle his visitors, and sometimes himself too.\nTo speak the truth, unless the company my father led upstairs were very clear-headed, or my uncle Toby was in one of his explanatory moods, 'twas difficult to keep the discourse free from obscurity.\nWhat especially perplexed my uncle Toby was this: that in the attack of the counterscarp, before the gate of St. Nicolas, extending from the bank of the Maes up to the water-stop, the ground was cut across with such a multitude of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, - and he would get so bewildered amongst them, that frequently he could neither go backwards or forwards; and was obliged to give up the attack on that account.\nThis perturbed my uncle Toby more than you would imagine: and as my father's kindness was continually dragging up fresh enquirers, he had a very uneasy time. When he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into the half-moon, or get out of the covered-way without falling down the counterscarp, nor cross the dyke without slipping into the ditch, he must have fretted inwardly.\nThese little vexations, which may seem trifling to the man who has not read Hippocrates, - yet whoever has read Hippocrates or Dr. James Mackenzie, and has considered well the effects which the passions have upon the digestion - (Why not of a wound as well as of a dinner?) - may easily conceive what sharp paroxysms of his wound my uncle Toby must have undergone.\nHaving borne the pain of it for three months together, he resolved to extricate himself.\nHe was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the wound upon his groin allowing him to lie in no other position, when a thought came into his head, that if he could have pasted upon a board a large map of the citadel of Namur and its environs, it might be a means of giving him ease. I note his desire to have the environs along with the citadel, because my uncle Toby's wound was got in one of the traverses, about a hundred yards from the angle of the trench opposite the demi-bastion of St. Roch: - so that he was pretty confident he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where the stone struck him.\nAll this was fulfilled, and not only freed him from a world of sad explanations, but proved the happy means, as you will read, of providing my uncle Toby with his Hobby-Horse.",
