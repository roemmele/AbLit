(_Susannah_ laid her hand upon _Trim's_ shoulder)--but corruption? ----_Susannah_ took it off.\nNow I love you for this--and 'tis this delicious mixture within you which makes you dear creatures what you are--and he who hates you for it------all I can say of the matter is --That he has either a pumpkin for his head--or a pippin for his heart, --and whenever he is dissected 'twill be found so.",

O Jonathan! 'twould make a man's heart bleed,' continued the corporal, 'to consider how low many a brave and upright fellow has been laid since that time!\n'And trust me, Susy,' he added, turning to Susannah, whose eyes were swimming, 'before that time comes round again, many a bright eye will be dim.' Susannah wept - but she curtsied too.\nTrim continued, still looking at her, 'Are we not like a flower of the field - is not all flesh grass? 'Tis clay, - 'tis dirt.'\n- They all looked at the scullery maid.\n'What is the finest face that ever man saw?'\n'I could hear Trim talk so for ever,' cried Susannah (laying her hand upon Trim's shoulder).\n'What is it - but corruption?' - Susannah took it off.\nNow I love you for this - 'tis this delicious mixture within you which makes you the dear creatures you are - and anyone who hates you for it - all I can say is, he has a pumpkin for his head.",
