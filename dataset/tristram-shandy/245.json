I think there was no occasion for it.\nNow this being a little bald about the chin, by frequently putting off and on, _before_ she was got with child by the coachman--not one of our family would wear it after. To cover the MASK afresh, was more than the mask was worth----and to wear a mask which was bald, or which could be half seen through, was as bad as having no mask at all----\nThis is the reason, may it please your reverences, that in all our numerous family, for these four generations, we count no more than one archbishop, a _Welch_ judge, some three or four aldermen, and a single mountebank----\nIn the sixteenth century, we boast of no less than a dozen alchymists.",
