If the sermon is of no better worth than to light pipes with - 'twas certainly, Sir, not good enough to be preached before so learned an assembly; and if 'twas good enough to be preached before us, 'twas certainly too good to light pipes with afterwards.'\nDidius thought, 'I have got him hung upon the horns of my dilemma - let him get off as he can.'\n'I have undergone such unspeakable torments, in bringing forth this sermon,' quoth Yorick, 'that I declare, Didius, I would suffer martyrdom before I would sit down and make such another. It came from my head instead of my heart - and it is for the pain it gave me, that I revenge myself on it in this manner. To preach - to parade before vulgar eyes our beggarly learning, tinselled over with a few words which glitter, but convey little light and less warmth - 'tis not preaching the gospel - but ourselves. For my own part,' continued he, 'I had rather direct five words point-blank to the heart.'\nAs Yorick pronounced the word point-blank, my uncle Toby rose up to say something upon projectiles - when a single word uttered from the opposite side of the table drew everyone's ears - a word of all others in the dictionary the last to be expected - a word I am ashamed to write - yet must be written - guess ten thousand guesses, you'll never get there-\nIn short, I'll tell it in the next chapter.",
