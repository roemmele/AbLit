Madam, had it been upon some melancholy lecture of the cross--the peace of meekness, or the contentment of resignation ----I had not been incommoded: or had I thought of writing it upon the purer abstractions of the soul, and that food of wisdom and holiness and contemplation, upon which the spirit of man (when separated from the body) is to subsist for ever ----You would have come with a better appetite from it----\n----I wish I never had wrote it: but as I never blot anything out----let us use some honest means to get it out of our heads directly.\n----Pray reach me my fool's cap ----I fear you sit upon it, Madam---- 'tis under the cushion ----I'll put it on----\nBless me! you have had it upon your head this half hour. ----There then let it stay, with a\nFa-ra diddle di and a fa-ri diddle d and a high-dum--dye-dum fiddle - - - dumb - c.\nAnd now, Madam, we may venture, I hope, a little to go on.",
