I cannot look at it---- What would the world say if I look'd at it? I should drop down, if I look'd at it-- I wish I could look at it---- There can be no sin in looking at it. ----I will look at it._\"\nWhilst all this was running through Mrs. _Wadman's_ imagination, my uncle _Toby_ had risen from the sopha, and got to the other side of the parlour door, to give _Trim_ an order about it in the passage----\n* * * * * * * * *\n* * ----I believe it is in the garret, said my uncle _Toby_ ----I saw it there, an' please your honour, this morning, answered _Trim_ ----Then prithee, step directly for it, _Trim_, said my uncle _Toby_, and bring it into the parlour.\nThe corporal did not approve of the orders, but most chearfully obeyed them. The first was not an act of his will--the second was; so he put on his _Montero_-cap, and went as fast as his lame knee would let him. My uncle _Toby_ returned into the parlour, and sat himself down again upon the sopha.\n----You shall lay your finger upon the place--said my uncle _Toby_. ----I will not touch it, however, quoth Mrs. _Wadman_ to herself.\nThis requires a second translation: --it shews what little knowledge is got by mere words--we must go up to the first springs.\nNow in order to clear up the mist which hangs upon these three pages, I must endeavour to be as clear as possible myself.\nRub your hands thrice across your foreheads--blow your noses--cleanse your emunctories--sneeze, my good people! ----God bless you----\nNow give me all the help you can.",

I cannot look at it - What would the world say if I looked at it? I should drop down, if I looked at it - I wish I could look at it - there can be no sin in looking at it - I will look at it.'\nWhilst all this was running through Mrs. Wadman's imagination, my uncle Toby had risen from the sofa, and left the parlour, to give Trim an order about it in the passage-\n* * * * * * * * *\n- 'I believe it is in the garret,' said my uncle Toby.\n'I saw it there, your honour, this morning,' answered Trim.\n'Then prithee, Trim,' said my uncle Toby, 'go and bring it into the parlour.'\nThe corporal did not approve of the order, but cheerfully obeyed. He put on his Montero-cap, and went as fast as his lame knee would let him. My uncle Toby returned into the parlour, and sat himself down again upon the sofa.\n'You shall lay your finger upon the place,' said my uncle Toby.\n'I will not touch it, however,' thought Mrs. Wadman.\nThis shows what little knowledge is got by mere words - we must go up to the source.\nNow in order to clear up the mist which hangs upon these three pages, I must try to be as clear as possible myself.\nRub your hands thrice across your foreheads - blow your noses - sneeze, my good people! - God bless you-\nNow give me all the help you can.",
