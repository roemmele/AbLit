He can, upon my honour, replied my uncle _Toby_. --Ask him, Mr. _Yorick_, any question you please.----\n--The fifth Commandment, _Trim_--said _Yorick_, speaking mildly, and with a gentle nod, as to a modest Catechumen. The corporal stood silent. --You don't ask him right, said my uncle _Toby_, raising his voice, and giving it rapidly like the word of command: ----The fifth--------cried my uncle _Toby_. --I must begin with the first, an' please your honour, said the corporal.----\n--_Yorick_ could not forbear smiling. --Your reverence does not consider, said the corporal, shouldering his stick like a musket, and marching into the middle of the room, to illustrate his position, --that 'tis exactly the same thing, as doing one's exercise in the field.--\n\"_Join your right-hand to your firelock_,\" cried the corporal, giving the word of command, and performing the motion.--\n\"_Poise your firelock_,\" cried the corporal, doing the duty still both of adjutant and private man.\n\"_Rest your firelock_;\" --one motion, an' please your reverence, you see leads into another. --If his honour will begin but with the _first_--\nTHE FIRST--cried my uncle _Toby_, setting his hand upon his side-- * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nTHE SECOND--cried my uncle _Toby_, waving his tobacco-pipe, as he would have done his sword at the head of a regiment. --The corporal went through his _manual_ with exactness! and having _honoured his father and mother_, made a low bow, and fell back to the side of the room.\nEverything in this world, said my father, is big with jest, --and has wit in it, and instruction too, --if we can but find it out.\n--Here is the _scaffold work_ of INSTRUCTION, its true point of folly, without the BUILDING behind it.\n--Here is the glass for pedagogues, preceptors, tutors, governors, gerund-grinders, and bear-leaders, to view themselves in, in their true dimensions.--\nOh! there is a husk and shell, _Yorick_, which grows up with learning, which their unskilfulness knows not how to fling away!\n--SCIENCES MAY BE LEARNED BY ROTE, BUT WISDOM NOT.\n_Yorick_ thought my father inspired. --I will enter into obligations this moment, said my father, to lay out all my aunt _Dinah's_ legacy in charitable uses (of which, by the bye, my father had no high opinion), if the corporal has any one determinate idea annexed to any one word he has repeated. --Prythee, _Trim_, quoth my father, turning round to him, --What dost thou mean, by \"_honouring thy father and mother?_\"\nAllowing them, an' please your honour, three half-pence a day out of my pay, when they grow old. --And didst thou do that, _Trim?_ said _Yorick_. --He did indeed, replied my uncle _Toby_. --Then, _Trim_, said _Yorick_, springing out of his chair, and taking the corporal by the hand, thou art the best commentator upon that part of the _Decalogue_; and I honour thee more for it, corporal _Trim_, than if thou hadst had a hand in the _Talmud_ itself.",

Raising his voice to a rapid tone of command, he cried: 'The fifth.'\n'I must begin with the first, an' please your honour,' said the corporal.\nYorick could not help smiling.\n'Your reverence does not consider,' said the corporal, shouldering his stick like a musket, and marching into the middle of the room, 'that 'tis exactly the same thing as presenting arms. - \"Join your right-hand to your firelock. Poise your firelock. Now rest your firelock,\"' said he, demonstrating with his stick, and acting as both commander and soldier. 'You see one leads into another. If his honour will begin but with the first-'\n'The First,' cried my uncle Toby, waving his tobacco-pipe like a sword.\nThe corporal went through his manual with exactness; and having honoured his father and mother, made a low bow, and stepped aside.\n'Everything in this world,' said my father, 'is big with jest, and has wit in it, if we can but find it.\n'Here in the Catechism is the scaffolding of Instruction, without the Building behind it.\n'Here is the looking-glass for teachers, tutors, and gerund-grinders, to view themselves in.\n'Oh! there is a husk and shell, Yorick, which grows up with learning, which they know not how to fling away!\n'Sciences may be learned by rote, but wisdom not.'\nYorick thought my father was inspired.\n'I will promise this moment,' said my father, 'to donate all my aunt Dinah's legacy to charitable causes' (of which, by the bye, my father had no high opinion), 'if the corporal has any one distinct idea attached to any one word he has repeated.- Prithee, Trim,' quoth my father, turning to him, 'What dost thou mean, by \"honouring thy father and mother?\"'\n'Allowing them, an' please your honour, three half-pence a day out of my pay, when they grow old.'\n'And didst thou do that, Trim?' said Yorick.\n'He did indeed,' replied my uncle Toby.\n'Then, Trim,' said Yorick, springing out of his chair, and shaking the corporal's hand, 'thou art the best commentator upon that commandment; and I honour thee more for it, corporal Trim, than if thou hadst had a hand in the Talmud itself.'",
