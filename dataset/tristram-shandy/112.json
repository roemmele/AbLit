If it is a tender part, which can easily be wrapped up-'\n'It is,' replied Phutatorius, lifting up his right leg to ventilate it.\n'In that case,' said Eugenius, 'I would advise you not to tamper with it; but send to the printer, and trust your cure to a soft sheet of paper just come off the press - simply twist it round.'\n'Although the damp paper has a refreshing coolness,' quoth Yorick, 'yet I presume it is the oil and lamp-black with which the paper is impregnated, which does the business.'\n'Right,' said Eugenius, 'and it is a remedy both anodyne and safe.'\n'As the main thing is the oil and lamp-black,' said Gastripheres, 'I should spread them thick upon a rag, and clap it on directly.'\n'That would not answer,' said Eugenius, 'for the neatness and elegance of the prescription is what matters. For if the type is a very small one, the useful particles have the advantage of being spread so infinitely thin, and with such a mathematical equality (large capitals excepted) as no management of the spatula can come up to.'\n'It is very lucky,' replied Phutatorius, 'that the second edition of my treatise is at this instant in the press.'\n'You may use any page of it,' said Eugenius.\n'Provided,' quoth Yorick, 'there is no bawdry in it.'\n'They are just now printing the ninth chapter,' replied Phutatorius.\n'Pray what is that chapter's title?' said Yorick, bowing respectfully.\n'De re concubinaria - On the Matter of Concubines.'\n'For Heaven's sake keep out of that chapter,' quoth Yorick.",
