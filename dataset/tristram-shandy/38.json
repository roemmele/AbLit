        "text": "At the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle _Toby_ were left both standing, like _Brutus_ and _Cassius_, at the close of the scene, making up their accounts.\nAs my father spoke the three last words, ----he sat down; --my uncle _Toby_ exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he rung the bell, to order Corporal _Trim_, who was in waiting, to step home for _Stevinus_: --my uncle _Toby's_ house being no farther off than the opposite side of the way.\nSome men would have dropped the subject of _Stevinus_; ----but my uncle _Toby_ had no resentment in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew my father that he had none.\nYour sudden appearance, Dr. _Slop_, quoth my uncle, resuming the discourse, instantly brought _Stevinus_ into my head. (My father, you may be sure, did not offer to lay any more wagers upon _Stevinus's_ head.) ----Because, continued my uncle _Toby_, the celebrated sailing chariot, which belonged to Prince _Maurice_, and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen people thirty _German_ miles, in I don't know how few minutes, ----was invented by _Stevinus_, that great mathematician and engineer.\nYou might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth Dr. _Slop_ (as the fellow is lame) of going for _Stevinus's_ account of it, because in my return from _Leyden_ thro' the _Hague_, I walked as far as _Schevling_, which is two long miles, on purpose to take a view of it.\nThat's nothing, replied my uncle _Toby_, to what the learned _Peireskius_ did, who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from _Paris_ to _Schevling_, and from _Schevling_ to _Paris_ back again, in order to see it, --and nothing else.\nSome men cannot bear to be out-gone.\nThe more fool _Peireskius_, replied Dr. _Slop_. But mark, 'twas out of no contempt of _Peireskius_ at all; ----but that _Peireskius's_ indefatigable labour in trudging so far on foot, out of love for the sciences, reduced the exploit of Dr. _Slop_, in that affair, to nothing: --the more fool _Peireskius_, said he again. --Why so? --replied my father, taking his brother's part, not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given him, which sat still upon my father's mind; ----but partly, that my father began really to interest himself in the discourse. ----Why so? ----said he. Why is _Peireskius_, or any man else, to be abused for an appetite for that, or any other morsel of sound knowledge: For notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot in question, continued he, the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head; and tho' I cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchieved it; --yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones, be they what they will, or it could not have answered at the rate my brother mentions.\nIt answered, replied my uncle _Toby_, as well, if not better; for, as _Peireskius_ elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its motion, _Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus_; which, unless I have forgot my Latin, is, _that it was as swift as the wind itself_.\nBut pray, Dr. _Slop_, quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not without begging pardon for it at the same time) upon what principles was this self-same chariot set a-going? --Upon very pretty principles to be sure, replied Dr. _Slop_: --And I have often wondered, continued he, evading the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains like this of ours, --(especially they whose wives are not past child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls, to which the sex is subject, --if the wind only served, --but would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost nothing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the devil take 'em) both cost and eat a great deal.\nFor that very reason, replied my father, \"Because they cost nothing, and because they eat nothing,\" --the scheme is bad; --it is the consumption of our products, as well as the manufactures of them, which gives bread to the hungry, circulates trade, --brings in money, and supports the value of our lands: --and tho', I own, if I was a Prince, I would generously recompense the scientifick head which brought forth such contrivances; --yet I would as peremptorily suppress the use of them.\nMy father here had got into his element, ----and was going on as prosperously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle _Toby_ had before, upon his of fortification; --but to the loss of much sound knowledge, the destinies in the morning had decreed that no dissertation of any kind should be spun by my father that day, ----for as he opened his mouth to begin the next sentence.",

        "text": "As my father spoke the last three words, he sat down. My uncle Toby rung the bell, to order Corporal Trim to step home for Stevinus: - my uncle's house being not far away.\nSome men would have dropped the subject of Stevinus; but my uncle Toby went on with the subject, to show my father that he bore him no resentment.\n'Your sudden appearance, Dr. Slop,' quoth he, 'instantly brought Stevinus into my head, because the celebrated sailing chariot belonging to Prince Maurice, which carried half a dozen people thirty miles in I don't know how few minutes, was invented by Stevinus, that great mathematician and engineer.'\n'You might have spared your servant the trouble of going for Stevinus's account of it,' quoth Dr. Slop, 'because in my return from Leyden through the Hague, I walked as far as Schevling, which is two long miles, to view it.'\n'That's nothing,' replied my uncle Toby. 'The learned Peireskius walked five hundred miles, from Paris to Schevling and back again, simply in order to see it.'\nSome men cannot bear to be out-done.\n'The more fool Peireskius,' replied Dr. Slop.\n'Why so?' replied my father, interested in the discussion. - 'Why is Peireskius to be abused for having an appetite for knowledge? For although I know nothing of the sailing chariot in question, and I cannot guess upon what principles it is made - yet certainly the machine was constructed upon solid ones, or it could not have worked as well as my brother says.'\n'It worked,' replied my uncle Toby, 'as well, if not better; for, as Peireskius said, it was as swift as the wind itself.'\n'Pray, Dr. Slop,' quoth my father, 'upon what principles was this chariot set a-going?'\n'Upon very pretty principles to be sure,' replied Dr. Slop, evading the question: 'and I have often wondered why none of our gentry, who live upon plains, attempt nothing of this kind; for 'twould be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost nothing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the devil take 'em) both cost and eat a great deal.'\n'For that very reason,' replied my father, 'the scheme is bad. It is the consumption of our products, as well as the manufacture of them, which gives bread to the hungry, circulates trade, and brings in money. - If I was a Prince, though I would generously reward the scientist who invented such things, yet I would also suppress the use of them.'\nMy father here had got into his element, and was going on as prosperously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle Toby had upon fortification; - but the destinies had decreed that no speech should be spun by my father that day, for as he opened his mouth to begin the next sentence,",
