An' please your Honour, quoth _Trim_, I officiated two whole campaigns, in _Flanders_, as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment. ----He can read it, quoth my uncle _Toby_, as well as I can. ----_Trim_, I assure you, was the best scholar in my company, and should have had the next halberd, but for the poor fellow's misfortune. Corporal _Trim_ laid his hand upon his heart, and made an humble bow to his master; --then laying down his hat upon the floor, and taking up the sermon in his left hand, in order to have his right at liberty, ----he advanced, nothing doubting, into the middle of the room, where he could best see, and be best seen by his audience.",

Bending the covers back, he gave the book a good sound shake.\n'There is something falling out,' said Trim, 'but it is not a chariot, or anything like one.'\n'Prithee, Corporal,' said my father, smiling, 'what is it then?'\n'I think,' answered Trim, stooping to take it up, ''tis more like a sermon.'\n'I cannot conceive how it is possible,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'for a sermon to have got into my Stevinus.'\n'If it please your Honours,' said Trim, 'I will read you a page;' for he loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk.\n'As we have nothing better to do,' replied my father, 'and if Dr. Slop has no objection, order the Corporal to give us a page or two of it, if he is able.'\n'He can read it,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'as well as I can. Trim was the best scholar in my company.'\nCorporal Trim made a humble bow to his master; then laying down his hat upon the floor, he advanced into the middle of the room, where he could best see and be seen by his audience.",
