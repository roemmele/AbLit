This, by the bye, was more than my father wanted----his aim in all the pains he was at in these philosophick lectures--was to enable my uncle _Toby_ not to _discuss_----but _comprehend_----to _hold_ the grains and scruples of learning----not to _weigh_ them. ----My uncle _Toby_, as you will read in the next chapter, did neither the one or the other.",
