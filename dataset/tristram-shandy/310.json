Therefore when _Obadiah's_ wife was brought to bed--_Obadiah_ thanked God----\n----Now, said _Obadiah_, I shall have a calf: so _Obadiah_ went daily to visit his cow.\nShe'll calve on _Monday_--on _Tuesday_--on _Wednesday_ at the farthest----\nThe cow did not calve----no--she'll not calve till next week----the cow put it off terribly----till at the end of the sixth week _Obadiah's_ suspicions (like a good man's) fell upon the Bull.\nNow the parish being very large, my father's Bull, to speak the truth of him, was no way equal to the department; he had, however, got himself, somehow or other, thrust into employment--and as he went through the business with a grave face, my father had a high opinion of him.\n----Most of the townsmen, an' please your worship, quoth _Obadiah_, believe that 'tis all the Bull's fault----\n----But may not a cow be barren? replied my father, turning to Doctor _Slop_.\nIt never happens: said Dr. _Slop_, but the man's wife may have come before her time naturally enough ----Prithee has the child hair upon his head? --added Dr. _Slop_------\n----It is as hairy as I am; said _Obadiah_. ----_Obadiah_ had not been shaved for three weeks ----Wheu - - u - - - - u - - - - - - - - cried my father; beginning the sentence with an exclamatory whistle----and so, brother _Toby_, this poor Bull of mine, who is as good a Bull as ever p--ss'd, and might have done for _Europa_ herself in purer times----had he but two legs less, might have been driven into Doctors Commons and lost his character----which to a Town Bull, brother _Toby_, is the very same thing as his life------\nL--d! said my mother, what is all this story about?----\nA COCK and a BULL, said _Yorick_ ----And one of the best of its kind, I ever heard.",

Why then did the delicacy of Diogenes and Plato so revolt against it? and why, when we are about to plant a child, do we put out the candle? and why are all the parts thereof held to be impossible to convey cleanly by any language or translation?\n'The act of killing and destroying a man,' continued my father, raising his voice and turning to my uncle Toby, 'you see, is glorious - and the weapons by which we do it are honourable. - We march with them upon our shoulders - We strut with them by our sides - We gild them - We carve them - We inlay them; even a scoundrel cannon has an ornament cast upon its breach.'\nMy uncle Toby laid down his pipe to intercede for a better epithet - and Yorick was rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to pieces-\n- When Obadiah burst into the room with a complaint which cried out for an immediate hearing.\nThe case was this:\nMy father, by ancient custom of the manor, was obliged to keep a Bull for the service of the Parish, and Obadiah had led his cow upon a pop-visit to him one day or other the preceding summer.\nI say, one day or other - because as chance would have it, it was the day on which he married my father's housemaid - so one was a reckoning for the other. Therefore when Obadiah's wife was brought to bed of a child, Obadiah thanked God.\n- 'Now,' said Obadiah, 'I shall have a calf:' so he went daily to visit his cow.\n'She'll calve on Monday - on Tuesday - on Wednesday at the latest-'\nThe cow did not calve. - 'no - she'll not calve till next week.'\nThe cow put it off terribly - till at the end of the sixth week Obadiah's suspicions fell upon the Bull.\nNow the parish being very large, my father's Bull, to speak the truth, was not equal to the job; he had, however, got himself thrust into employment - and as he went through the business with a grave face, my father had a high opinion of him.\n'Most of the townsmen,' quoth Obadiah, 'believe that 'tis all the Bull's fault.'\n'But may not a cow be barren?' replied my father, turning to Doctor Slop.\n'It never happens,' said Dr. Slop; 'but Obadiah's wife may have come before her time. - Prithee has the child hair upon his head?'\n'It is as hairy as I am,' said Obadiah; he had not shaved for three weeks.\n'Wheu - - u - - u - -' cried my father, with an exclamatory whistle; 'and so, brother Toby, this poor Bull of mine, who is as good a Bull as ever p_ssed, and might have done for Europa herself - had he but two legs less, he might have lost his character - which to a Town Bull is the very same thing as his life-'\n'L__d!' said my mother. 'What is all this story about?'\n'A Cock and a Bull,' said Yorick. '- And one of the best of its kind, I ever heard.'",
