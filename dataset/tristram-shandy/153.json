        "text": "The description of the siege of _Jericho_ itself, could not have engaged the attention of my uncle _Toby_ more powerfully than the last chapter; --his eyes were fixed upon my father throughout it; --he never mentioned radical heat and radical moisture, but my uncle _Toby_ took his pipe out of his mouth, and shook his head; and as soon as the chapter was finished, he beckoned to the corporal to come close to his chair, to ask him the following question, --_aside_. ---- * * * * * * * * * It was at the siege of _Limerick_, an' please your honour, replied the corporal, making a bow.\nThe poor fellow and I, quoth my uncle _Toby_, addressing himself to my father, were scarce able to crawl out of our tents, at the time the siege of _Limerick_ was raised, upon the very account you mention. ----Now what can have got into that precious noddle of thine, my dear brother _Toby?_ cried my father, mentally. ----By Heaven! continued he, communing still with himself, it would puzzle an _dipus_ to bring it in point.----\nI believe, an' please your honour, quoth the corporal, that if it had not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every night, and the claret and cinnamon with which I plyed your honour off; --And the geneva, _Trim_, added my uncle _Toby_, which did us more good than all ----I verily believe, continued the corporal, we had both, an' please your honour, left our lives in the trenches, and been buried in them too. ----The noblest grave, corporal! cried my uncle _Toby_, his eyes sparkling as he spoke, that a soldier could wish to lie down in. ----But a pitiful death for him! an' please your honour, replied the corporal.\nAll this was as much _Arabick_ to my father, as the rites of the _Colchi_ and _Troglodites_ had been before to my uncle _Toby_; my father could not determine whether he was to frown or to smile.----\nMy uncle _Toby_, turning to _Yorick_, resumed the case at _Limerick_, more intelligibly than he had begun it, --and so settled the point for my father at once.",

His eyes were fixed upon my father throughout it; whenever he mentioned radical heat and radical moisture, my uncle took his pipe out of his mouth, and shook his head; and as soon as the chapter was finished, he beckoned to the corporal, to ask him the following question, (aside) - * * * * * * * * *?\n'It was at the siege of Limerick, your honour,' replied the corporal.\n'The poor fellow and I,' quoth my uncle Toby to my father, 'were scarce able to crawl out of our tents, when the siege of Limerick was raised, for the very reason you mention.'\n'Now what can have got into that precious noddle of thine, my dear brother?' cried my father, mentally.\n'I believe,' quoth the corporal, 'that if it had not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every night, and the claret and cinnamon which I gave your honour-'\n'-And the Geneva gin, Trim,' added my uncle Toby, 'which did us more good than all-'\n'-I verily believe, your honour,' continued the corporal, 'we would both have died in the trenches, and been buried there.'\n'The noblest grave a soldier could wish for, corporal!' cried my uncle Toby, his eyes sparkling.\n'But a pitiful death!' replied the corporal.\nAll this was as much Arabic to my father; he did not know whether to frown or smile.\nMy uncle Toby, turning to Yorick, began the account of Limerick, and settled the point for my father at once.",
