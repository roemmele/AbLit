She contented herself with doing all that her godfathers and godmothers promised for her--but no more; and so would go on using a hard word twenty years together--and replying to it too, if it was a verb, in all its moods and tenses, without giving herself any trouble to enquire about it.\nThis was an eternal source of misery to my father, and broke the neck, at the first setting out, of more good dialogues between them, than could have done the most petulant contradiction----the few which survived were the better for the _cuvetts_----\n--\"They are foolish things;\" said my mother.\n----Particularly the _cuvetts_; replied my father.\n'Tis enough--he tasted the sweet of triumph--and went on.\n--Not that they are, properly speaking, Mrs. _Wadman's_ premises, said my father, partly correcting himself--because she is but tenant for life----\n----That makes a great difference--said my mother----\n--In a fool's head, replied my father----\nUnless she should happen to have a child--said my mother--\n----But she must persuade my brother _Toby_ first to get her one--\n----To be sure, Mr. _Shandy_, quoth my mother.\n----Though if it comes to persuasion--said my father --Lord have mercy upon them.\nAmen: said my mother, _piano_.\nAmen: cried my father, _fortissim_.\nAmen: said my mother again----but with such a sighing cadence of personal pity at the end of it, as discomfited every fibre about my father--he instantly took out his almanack; but before he could untie it, _Yorick's_ congregation coming out of church, became a full answer to one half of his business with it--and my mother telling him it was a sacrament day--left him as little in doubt, as to the other part --He put his almanack into his pocket.\nThe first Lord of the Treasury thinking of _ways and means_, could not have returned home with a more embarrassed look.",

She would go on using a hard word twenty years together, without giving herself any trouble to enquire about it.\nThis was an eternal source of misery to my father, and cut short more good dialogues between them, than the most petulant contradiction could have done. The few which survived were the better for the cuvetts - the ditches within ditches.\n'They are foolish things;' said my mother.\n'Particularly the cuvetts,' replied my father.\nHe tasted the sweet of triumph - and went on.\n'Not that they are, properly speaking, Mrs. Wadman's premises,' said my father, 'because she is only tenant for life.'\n'That makes a great difference,' said my mother.\n'In a fool's head,' replied my father.\n'Unless she should happen to have a child,' said my mother.\n'But she must persuade my brother Toby first to get her one.'\n'To be sure,' quoth my mother.\n'Though if it comes to persuasion,' said my father, 'Lord have mercy upon them.'\n'Amen,' said my mother, piano.\n'Amen,' cried my father, fortissimo.\n'Amen,' said my mother again - but with such a sigh of personal pity, as discomfited every fibre of my father. He instantly took out his almanac; but before he could look in it, Yorick's congregation coming out of church, answered half of his business with it - and my mother telling him it was a sacrament day answered the other half.\nMy father, remiss in not attending church, put his almanac into his pocket, and returned home with a most embarrassed look.",
