You shall hear in the next chapter.\n[Footnote 4.8: According to the original Editions.]",

He'll knock his brains out against their posts - he's bounced out! - look - he's riding like a mad-cap full tilt through a crowd of painters, poets, physicians, lawyers, churchmen, statesmen, soldiers, prelates, popes, and engineers.\n'Don't fear,' said I, 'I'll not hurt the poorest jackass upon the road.'\n'But your horse throws dirt; see, you've splashed a bishop!'\n'I hope to God, 'twas only Ernulphus,' said I.\n'But you've squirted full in the faces of the doctors of the Sorbonne!'\n'That was last year,' replied I.\n'But you have just trod upon a king!'\n'I deny it,' quoth I, and so have got off, and here am I standing with my bridle in one hand, and my cap in the other, to tell my story.\nAnd what is it? You shall hear in the next chapter.",
