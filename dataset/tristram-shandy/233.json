Defend me! cried I----\nI travel by water --I am going down the _Rhne_ this very afternoon--my baggage is in the boat--and I have actually paid nine livres for my passage----\n_C'est tout egal_--'tis all one; said he.\n_Bon Dieu!_ what, pay for the way I go! and for the way I do _not_ go!\n----_C'est tout egal_; replied the commissary----\n----The devil it is! said I--but I will go to ten thousand Bastiles first----\n_O England! England!_ thou land of liberty, and climate of good sense, thou tenderest of mothers--and gentlest of nurses, cried I, kneeling upon one knee, as I was beginning my apostrophe.\nWhen the director of Madam _Le Blanc's_ conscience coming in at that instant, and seeing a person in black, with a face as pale as ashes, at his devotions--looking still paler by the contrast and distress of his drapery--ask'd, if I stood in want of the aids of the church----\nI go by WATER--said I--and here's another will be for making me pay for going by OIL.",

Since it is a post royal, you pay double for the horses and postillion - otherwise 'twould have been three livres two sous.'\n'But I don't go by land,' said I.\n'You may if you please,' replied he.\n'Your most obedient servant,' said I, making him a bow - he bowed as low in return. - I was never more disconcerted with a bow in my life.\n'The devil take the serious character of these people!' quoth I (aside). 'They understand no more of Irony than this-'\nThe comparison was standing close by with his panniers - but I could not say his name.\n'Sir,' said I, collecting myself, 'it is not my intention to take the post-stage.'\n'But you may,' said he, 'if you choose.'\n'And I may take salt on my pickled herring,' said I, 'if I choose - but I do not choose.'\n'But you must pay for the post-stage, whether you do or no.'\n'Defend me!' I cried. 'I travel by water - I am going down the Rhne this very afternoon - my baggage is in the boat - and I have actually paid nine livres for my passage.'\n''Tis all one,' said he.\n'Mon Dieu! what, pay for the way I go! and for the way I do not go!'\n''Tis all one.'\n'The devil it is!' said I - 'but I will go to ten thousand Bastilles first - O England! England! thou land of liberty and good sense, thou tenderest of mothers and gentlest of nurses,' cried I, falling upon one knee.\nThe priest coming in at that instant, and seeing a person in black, kneeling, with a face as pale as ashes, asked if I needed the aid of the church-\n'I go by Water,' said I; '-and here's another wants to make me pay for going by Oil.'",
