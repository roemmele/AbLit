        "text": "My father's collection was not great, but to make amends, it was curious; and consequently he was some time in making it; he had the great good fortune however, to set off well, in getting _Bruscambille's_ prologue upon long noses, almost for nothing--for he gave no more for _Bruscambille_ than three half-crowns; owing indeed to the strong fancy which the stall-man saw my father had for the book the moment he laid his hands upon it. ----There are not three _Bruscambilles_ in _Christendom_--said the stall-man, except what are chain'd up in the libraries of the curious. My father flung down the money as quick as lightning----took _Bruscambille_ into his bosom----hied home from _Piccadilly_ to _Coleman_-street with it, as he would have hied home with a treasure, without taking his hand once off from _Bruscambille_ all the way.\nTo those who do not yet know of which gender _Bruscambille_ is------inasmuch as a prologue upon long noses might easily be done by either------'twill be no objection against the simile--to say, That when my father got home, he solaced himself with _Bruscambille_ after the manner in which, 'tis ten to one, your worship solaced yourself with your first mistress------that is, from morning even unto night: which, by the bye, how delightful soever it may prove to the inamorato--is of little or no entertainment at all to by-standers. ----Take notice, I go no farther with the simile--my father's eye was greater than his appetite--his zeal greater than his knowledge--he cool'd--his affections became divided----he got hold of _Prignitz_--purchased _Scroderus_, _Andrea Parus_, _Bouchet's_ Evening Conferences, and above all, the great and learned _Hafen Slawkenbergius_; of which, as I shall have much to say by and by --I will say nothing now.",
