'Tis a cursed place; when once a poor creature is in, he is in for ever.'\n''Tis very true,' said my uncle Toby, looking gravely at Mrs. Wadman's house as he spoke.\n'Nothing,' continued the corporal, 'can be so sad as confinement for life - or so sweet as liberty.'\n'Nothing, Trim,' said my uncle, musing.\n'Whilst a man is free -' cried the corporal, giving a flourish with his stick thus:\nMy uncle Toby looked earnestly towards his cottage and his bowling-green.\nThe corporal had unwarily conjured up the Spirit of calculation with his wand; so he then began to conjure him down again with his story.",
