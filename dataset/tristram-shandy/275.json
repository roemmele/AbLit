        "text": "As the ancients agree, brother _Toby_, said my father, that there are two different and distinct kinds of _love_, according to the different parts which are affected by it--the Brain or Liver ----I think when a man is in love, it behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen into.\nWhat signifies it, brother _Shandy_, replied my uncle _Toby_, which of the two it is, provided it will but make a man marry, and love his wife, and get a few children?\n----A few children! cried my father, rising out of his chair, and looking full in my mother's face, as he forced his way betwixt her's and doctor _Slop's_--a few children! cried my father, repeating my uncle _Toby's_ words as he walk'd to and fro----\n----Not, my dear brother _Toby_, cried my father, recovering himself all at once, and coming close up to the back of my uncle _Toby's_ chair--not that I should be sorry hadst thou a score--on the contrary, I should rejoice--and be as kind, _Toby_, to every one of them as a father--\nMy uncle _Toby_ stole his hand unperceived behind his chair, to give my father's a squeeze----\n----Nay, moreover, continued he, keeping hold of my uncle _Toby's_ hand--so much dost thou possess, my dear _Toby_, of the milk of human nature, and so little of its asperities--'tis piteous the world is not peopled by creatures which resemble thee; and was I an _Asiatic_ monarch, added my father, heating himself with his new project --I would oblige thee, provided it would not impair thy strength--or dry up thy radical moisture too fast--or weaken thy memory or fancy, brother _Toby_, which these gymnics inordinately taken are apt to do--else, dear _Toby_, I would procure thee the most beautiful women in my empire, and I would oblige thee, _nolens, volens_, to beget for me one subject every _month_----\nAs my father pronounced the last word of the sentence--my mother took a pinch of snuff.\nNow I would not, quoth my uncle _Toby_, get a child, _nolens, volens_, that is, whether I would or no, to please the greatest prince upon earth----\n----And 'twould be cruel in me, brother _Toby_, to compel thee; said my father--but 'tis a case put to show thee, that it is not thy begetting a child--in case thou should'st be able--but the system of Love and Marriage thou goest upon, which I would set thee right in----\nThere is at least, said _Yorick_, a great deal of reason and plain sense in captain _Shandy's_ opinion of love; and 'tis amongst the ill-spent hours of my life, which I have to answer for, that I have read so many flourishing poets and rhetoricians in my time, from whom I never could extract so much----\nI wish, _Yorick_, said my father, you had read _Plato_; for there you would have learnt that there are two LOVES --I know there were two RELIGIONS, replied _Yorick_, amongst the ancients----one--for the vulgar, and another for the learned; --but I think ONE LOVE might have served both of them very well--\nIt could not; replied my father--and for the same reasons: for of these Loves, according to _Ficinus's_ comment upon _Velasius_, the one is rational----\n----the other is _natural_----\nthe first ancient----without mother----where _Venus_ had nothing to do: the second, begotten of _Jupiter_ and _Dione_--\n----Pray, brother, quoth my uncle _Toby_, what has a man who believes in God to do with this? My father could not stop to answer, for fear of breaking the thread of his discourse----\nThis latter, continued he, partakes wholly of the nature of _Venus_.\nThe first, which is the golden chain let down from heaven, excites to love heroic, which comprehends in it, and excites to the desire of philosophy and truth----the second, excites to _desire_, simply----\n----I think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world, said _Yorick_, as the finding out of the longitude----\n----To be sure, said my mother, _love_ keeps peace in the world----\n----In the _house_--my dear, I own--\n----It replenishes the earth; said my mother----\nBut it keeps heaven empty--my dear; replied my father.\n----'Tis Virginity, cried _Slop_, triumphantly, which fills paradise.\nWell push'd, nun! quoth my father.",

'A few children!' he repeated as he walked to and fro.\n'Not, my dear brother Toby,' he cried, recovering himself, 'not that I should be sorry if thou hadst - on the contrary, I should rejoice - and be as kind to every one of them as a father-'\nMy uncle Toby stole his hand into my father's to give it a squeeze.\n'Nay, moreover,' continued he, 'so full art thou, my dear Toby, of the milk of human nature, 'tis a pity the world is not peopled by creatures like thee; and was I an Asiatic monarch, I would oblige thee, provided it would not impair thy strength - or weaken thy mind, brother Toby, which these gymnics are apt to do - otherwise, dear Toby, I would procure thee the most beautiful women in my empire, and I would oblige thee, willy nilly, to beget one subject every month.'\n'Now I would not,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'get a child, willy nilly, that is, whether I wished or no, to please the greatest prince upon earth.'\n'And 'twould be cruel in me, brother, to compel thee;' said my father; 'but 'tis a case put to show thee, that it is not thy begetting a child, but the system of Love and Marriage, which I would set thee right in.'\n'There is a great deal of plain sense in captain Shandy's opinion of love,' said Yorick. 'Amongst the ill-spent hours of my life, I have read many flourishing poets, from whom I never could extract so much-'\n'I wish, Yorick,' said my father, 'you had read Plato; for there you would have learnt that there are two Loves.'\n'I know there were two Religions among the ancients,' replied Yorick, 'one for the vulgar, and another for the learned; but I think one Love might have served both of them very well.'\n'It could not,' replied my father, 'because according to Ficinus, one of these loves is rational - the other is natural. The first is ancient - without mother: the second, begotten of Jupiter and Dione.'\n'Pray, brother,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'what has a man who believes in God to do with this?'\nMy father could not stop to answer, for fear of breaking his thread.\n'The latter,' continued he, 'is wholly of the nature of Venus. The first excites to heroic love, and the desire of philosophy and truth - the second excites to desire, simply-'\n'I think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world,' said Yorick, 'as the finding out of the longitude.'\n'To be sure,' said my mother, 'love keeps peace in the world.'\n'In the house, my dear, I own-'\n'It replenishes the earth,' said my mother.\n'But it keeps heaven empty - my dear,' replied my father.\n''Tis Virginity,' cried Slop triumphantly, 'which fills paradise.'\n'Well said, nun!' quoth my father.",
