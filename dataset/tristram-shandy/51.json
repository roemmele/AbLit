My mother, Madam, had been delivered sooner than the green bag infallibly----at least by twenty _knots_. ----Sport of small accidents, _Tristram Shandy!_ that thou art, and ever will be! had that trial been for thee, and it was fifty to one but it had, ----thy affairs had not been so depress'd--(at least by the depression of thy nose) as they have been; nor had the fortunes of thy house and the occasions of making them, which have so often presented themselves in the course of thy life, to thee, been so often, so vexatiously, so tamely, so irrecoverably abandoned--as thou hast been forced to leave them; ----but 'tis over, ----all but the account of 'em, which cannot be given to the curious till I am got out into the world.",

Obadiah did not hesitate to use his. So taking hold of the bag and instruments, and gripping them together with one hand, and with his other hand and his teeth pulling the hat-band down over them, he tied and cross-tied them all fast together from one end to the other with such a multiplicity of roundabouts and cross turns, with a knot at every intersection, that Dr. Slop must have had three-fifths of Job's patience to have unloosed them.\nNo man living who had seen that bag, who knew with what great speed Nature can hasten childbirth when she thinks proper, would have had the least doubt about which between Dr. Slop and Nature would have won the race. My mother, Madam, would have been delivered sooner than the green bag, by at least twenty knots.\nThe victim of small accidents, Tristram Shandy! thou wilt ever be! Had that happened - thy affairs would have not been so depressed - (at least by the depression of thy nose); nor the fortunes of thy house so often, so vexatiously abandoned - but 'tis over, all but the account of 'em, which cannot be given to the curious till I am got out into the world.",
