One of them fell upon the ground - I instantly saw it was my writing-\n'O! you have got my remarks upon your head, Madam!' cried I.\n'J'en suis bien mortifie,' said she.\n'Twas as well they stuck there - for if they had gone deeper, they would have made such confusion in a Frenchwoman's noddle that she would have been better off unfrizzled.\n'Tenez,' said she - and taking them from her curls, she put them gravely one by one into my hat - one twisted this way - and one that-\n'By my faith,' quoth I, 'when they are published, they will be worse twisted still.'",
