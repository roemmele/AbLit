        "text": "--No doubt, Sir, --there is a whole chapter wanting here--and a chasm of ten pages made in the book by it--but the bookbinder is neither a fool, or a knave, or a puppy--nor is the book a jot more imperfect (at least upon that score)----but, on the contrary, the book is more perfect and complete by wanting the chapter, than having it, as I shall demonstrate to your reverences in this manner. --I question first, by the bye, whether the same experiment might not be made as successfully upon sundry other chapters------but there is no end, an' please your reverences, in trying experiments upon chapters------we have had enough of it ----So there's an end of that matter.\nBut before I begin my demonstration, let me only tell you, that the chapter which I have torn out, and which otherwise you would all have been reading just now, instead of this----was the description of my father's, my uncle _Toby's_, _Trim's_, and _Obadiah's_ setting out and journeying to the visitation at ****.\nWe'll go in the coach, said my father --Prithee, have the arms been altered, _Obadiah?_ --It would have made my story much better to have begun with telling you, that at the time my mother's arms were added to the _Shandy's_, when the coach was re-painted upon my father's marriage, it had so fallen out, that the coach-painter, whether by performing all his works with the left-hand, like _Turpilius_ the _Roman_, or _Hans Holbein_ of _Basil_----or whether 'twas more from the blunder of his head than hand----or whether, lastly, it was from the sinister turn which every thing relating to our family was apt to take----it so fell out, however, to our reproach, that instead of the _bend-dexter_, which since _Harry_ the Eighth's reign was honestly our due------a _bend-sinister_, by some of these fatalities, had been drawn quite across the field of the _Shandy_ arms. 'Tis scarce credible that the mind of so wise a man as my father was, could be so much incommoded with so small a matter. The word coach--let it be whose it would--or coach-man, or coach-horse, or coach-hire, could never be named in the family, but he constantly complained of carrying this vile mark of illegitimacy upon the door of his own; he never once was able to step into the coach, or out of it, without turning round to take a view of the arms, and making a vow at the same time, that it was the last time he would ever set his foot in it again, till the _bend-sinister_ was taken out--but like the affair of the hinge, it was one of the many things which the _Destinies_ had set down in their books ever to be grumbled at (and in wiser families than ours)----but never to be mended.\n--Has the _bend-sinister_ been brush'd out, I say? said my father. ----There has been nothing brush'd out, Sir, answered _Obadiah_, but the lining. We'll go o'horseback, said my father, turning to _Yorick_. ----Of all things in the world, except politicks, the clergy know the least of heraldry, said _Yorick_. --No matter for that, cried my father ----I should be sorry to appear with a blot in my escutcheon before them. --Never mind the _bend-sinister_, said my uncle _Toby_, putting on his tye-wig. ----No, indeed, said my father--you may go with my aunt _Dinah_ to a visitation with a _bend-sinister_, if you think fit --My poor uncle _Toby_ blush'd. My father was vexed at himself. ------No----my dear brother _Toby_, said my father, changing his tone----but the damp of the coach-lining about my loins, may give me the sciatica again, as it did _December_, _January_, and _February_ last _winter_--so if you please you shall ride my wife's pad----and as you are to preach, _Yorick_, you had better make the best of your way before----and leave me to take care of my brother _Toby_, and to follow at our own rates.\nNow the chapter I was obliged to tear out, was the description of this cavalcade, in which Corporal _Trim_ and _Obadiah_, upon two coach-horses a-breast, led the way as slow as a patrole----whilst my uncle _Toby_, in his laced regimentals and tye-wig, kept his rank with my father, in deep roads and dissertations alternately upon the advantage of learning and arms, as each could get the start.\n--But the painting of this journey, upon reviewing it, appears to be so much above the stile and manner of anything else I have been able to paint in this book, that it could not have remained in it, without depreciating every other scene; and destroying at the same time that necessary equipoise and balance, (whether of good or bad) betwixt chapter and chapter, from whence the just proportions and harmony of the whole work results. For my own part, I am but just set up in the business, so know little about it--but, in my opinion, to write a book is for all the world like humming a song--but in tune with yourself, madam, 'tis no matter how high or how low you take it.\n--This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that some of the lowest and flattest compositions pass off very well----(as _Yorick_ told my uncle _Toby_ one night) by siege. ----My uncle _Toby_ looked brisk at the sound of the word _siege_, but could make neither head or tail of it.\nI'm to preach at court next Sunday, said _Homenas_----run over my notes----so I humm'd over doctor _Homenas's_ notes--the modulation's very well----'twill do, _Homenas_, if it holds on at this rate----so on I humm'd----and a tolerable tune I thought it was; and to this hour, may it please your reverences, had never found out how low, how flat, how spiritless and jejune it was, but that all of a sudden, up started an air in the middle of it, so fine, so rich, so heavenly, --it carried my soul up with it into the other world; now had I (as _Montaigne_ complained in a parallel accident)--had I found the declivity easy, or the ascent accessible------certes I had been outwitted. ------Your notes, _Homenas_, I should have said, are good notes; ----but it was so perpendicular a precipice------so wholly cut off from the rest of the work, that by the first note I humm'd I found myself flying into the other world, and from thence discovered the vale from whence I came, so deep, so low, and dismal, that I shall never have the heart to descend into it again.\n[-->] A dwarf who brings a standard along with him to measure his own size--take my word, is a dwarf in more articles than one. --And so much for tearing out of chapters.",

        "text": "- No doubt, Sir - there is a whole chapter (number 24) missing here - and a chasm of ten pages made in the book by it - but the bookbinder is neither a fool, or a knave, nor is the book a jot more imperfect - but, on the contrary, is more perfect by missing the chapter, than having it, as I shall demonstrate.\n- I question, by the bye, whether the same experiment might not be made successfully upon various other chapters - but there is no end in trying experiments upon chapters - so enough.\nBut before I begin my demonstration, let me just tell you, that the chapter which I have torn out, and which otherwise you would be reading now, was the description of my father's, my uncle Toby's, Trim's, and Obadiah's setting out and journeying to the visit at ****.\n'We'll go in the coach,' said my father - 'Prithee, has the coat of arms been altered, Obadiah?'\nIt would have made my story much better to have begun with telling you that at the time my mother's heraldic arms were added to the Shandy's, when the coach was re-painted upon their marriage, it had so happened that the coach-painter - whether by painting all his works with the left-hand, like Hans Holbein - or whether 'twas a blunder - or the sinister turn which everything relating to our family was apt to take - it happened that, instead of the bend-dexter, which since Harry the Eighth's reign was honestly our due, a bend-sinister, the emblem of a child born out of wedlock, had been drawn across the field of the Shandy coat of arms.\n'Tis scarce credible that a man as wise as my father, could be so much incommoded with so small a matter. The word coach, or coach-man, or coach-horse, could never be named, without him complaining of carrying this vile mark of illegitimacy upon his own coach; he was never able to step in or out of it, without turning round to view the arms, and vowing that it was the last time he would ever set his foot in it, till the bend-sinister was removed. But like the hinge, it was destined ever to be grumbled at, and never to be mended.\n'Has the bend-sinister been brushed out?' said my father.\n'No, Sir,' answered Obadiah.\n'We'll go on horseback,' said my father, turning to Yorick.\n'The clergy know nothing of heraldry,' said Yorick.\n'No matter,' cried my father.\n'Never mind the bend-sinister,' said my uncle Toby, putting on his tie-wig.\n'No, indeed,' said my father. 'You may go with my aunt Dinah on a visit with a bend-sinister, if you think fit.'\nMy poor uncle blushed. My father was vexed at himself.\n'No - my dear brother,' he said, changing his tone, 'but the damp of the coach may give me the sciatica again, - so if you please, you shall ride my wife's horse - and as you are to preach, Yorick, you had better make your way before us - and we shall follow at our own rates.'\nNow the chapter I was obliged to tear out, was the description of this cavalcade, in which Corporal Trim and Obadiah, upon two coach-horses, slowly led the way - whilst my uncle Toby, in his laced regimentals and tie-wig, rode alongside my father.\nBut the painting of this journey is so much above the style of anything else I have painted in this book, that it could not have remained here without depreciating every other scene; and destroying that necessary balance betwixt chapters, from which the harmony of the whole work results. I am only just set up in the business, so know little about it - but, in my opinion, to write a book is like humming a song - stay in tune with yourself, madam, no matter how high or how low you take it.\n'I'm to preach at court next Sunday,' said Homenas; 'run over my notes.' So I hummed over his notes - and a tolerable tune I thought it, never noticing how low, flat, and spiritless it was, until all of a sudden, up started a melody in the middle of it, so fine, so rich, so heavenly - it carried my soul up into the other world. 'Your notes, Homenas,' I should have said, 'are good notes; - but it was so perpendicular a precipice - so cut off from the rest of the work, that I found myself flying into the other world, and discovered that the vale from which I had come was so deep and dismal, that I shall never have the heart to descend into it again.'\n- And so much for tearing out of chapters.",
