She went out of the world at last without knowing whether it turned round, or stood still. My father had officiously told her a thousand times which way it was, but she always forgot.\nFor these reasons, a discourse between them seldom went on much further than a proposition, a reply, and a rejoinder; after which, it generally took breath for a few minutes (as in the affair of the breeches), and then went on again.\n'If he marries, 'twill be the worse for us,' quoth my mother.\n'Not much,' said my father; 'he may as well batter away his means upon that, as any thing else.'\n'To be sure,' said my mother: so here ended the proposition, the reply and the rejoinder.\n'It will be some amusement to him, too,' said my father.\n'A very great one,' answered my mother, 'if he should have children.'\n'Lord have mercy upon me,' said my father to himself. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.",
