        "text": "When I reflect, brother _Toby_, upon MAN; and take a view of that dark side of him which represents his life as open to so many causes of trouble--when I consider, brother _Toby_, how oft we eat the bread of affliction, and that we are born to it, as to the portion of our inheritance ------I was born to nothing, quoth my uncle _Toby_, interrupting my father--but my commission. Zooks! said my father, did not my uncle leave you a hundred and twenty pounds a year? ------What could I have done without it? replied my uncle _Toby_ ------That's another concern, said my father testily --But I say, _Toby_, when one runs over the catalogue of all the cross-reckonings and sorrowful _Items_ with which the heart of man is overcharged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden resources the mind is enabled to stand out, and bear itself up, as it does, against the impositions laid upon our nature. ------'Tis by the assistance of Almighty God, cried my uncle _Toby_, looking up, and pressing the palms of his hands close together----'tis not from our own strength, brother _Shandy_----a centinel in a wooden centry-box might as well pretend to stand it out against a detachment of fifty men. ----We are upheld by the grace and the assistance of the best of Beings.\n----That is cutting the knot, said my father, instead of untying it. ----But give me leave to lead you, brother _Toby_, a little deeper into the mystery.\nWith all my heart, replied my uncle _Toby_.\nMy father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in, for that in which _Socrates_ is so finely painted by _Raffael_ in his school of _Athens_; which your connoisseurship knows is so exquisitely imagined, that even the particular manner of the reasoning of _Socrates_ is expressed by it--for he holds the forefinger of his left hand between the forefinger and the thumb of his right, and seems as if he was saying to the libertine he is reclaiming------ \"_You grant me_ this----and this: and this, and this, I don't ask of you--they follow of themselves in course.\"\nSo stood my father, holding fast his forefinger betwixt his finger and his thumb, and reasoning with my uncle _Toby_ as he sat in his old fringed chair, valanced around with party-coloured worsted bobs ----O _Garrick!_--what a rich scene of this would thy exquisite powers make! and how gladly would I write such another to avail myself of thy immortality, and secure my own behind it.",

'But I say, Toby, when one runs over the catalogue of all the sorrows with which the heart of man is overcharged, 'tis wonderful how the mind can bear itself up, as it does.'\n''Tis by the assistance of Almighty God,' cried my uncle Toby. ''Tis not from our own strength, brother Shandy - a sentinel might as well pretend to stand against fifty men. We are upheld by the grace of the best of Beings.'\n'That is cutting the knot,' said my father, 'instead of untying it. But allow me to lead you, brother, a little deeper into the mystery.'\n'With all my heart,' replied my uncle.\nMy father instantly took up the attitude in which Socrates is so finely painted by Raphael; which your connoisseurship knows is so exquisitely imagined, that even the particular manner of the reasoning of Socrates is expressed by it - for he holds the forefinger of his left hand between the forefinger and the thumb of his right.\nSo stood my father, holding his forefinger betwixt his finger and his thumb, and reasoning with my uncle Toby in his old fringed chair with woollen bobs - O Garrick! what a rich scene wouldst thou make of this! and how gladly would I write such another to secure my immortality.",
