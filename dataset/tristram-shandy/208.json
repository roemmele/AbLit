I could not count a single point: so had been piqued and repiqued, and capotted to the devil.",

She has been eighteen months at school in Amiens, and six at Paris; so she knits, and sews, and dances, and does the little coquetries very well.\n- A slut! In these five minutes that I have stood looking at her, she has let fall at least a dozen loops in a white thread stocking - yes, yes, I see, you cunning gipsy! - you need not pin it to your knee.\n- That Nature should have told this creature about a statue's thumb!\n- But as this sample is worth all their thumbs - and as Janatone (for that is her name) stands so well for a drawing - may I never draw more, if I do not draw her in all her proportions, and with as determined a pencil, as if I had her in the wettest drapery.\n- But your worships choose rather that I should give you the length, breadth, and height of the great parish-church, or draw the abbey of Saint Austerberte, which was transported here from Artois, so that your worships may measure them at your leisure. But he who measures thee, Janatone, must do it now - thy frame will change - and before twice twelve months are passed, thou mayest grow out like a pumpkin, and lose thy shape - or thou mayest go off like a flower, and lose thy beauty - nay, thou mayest go off like a hussy, and lose thyself.\nBut if I go on with my drawing, I'll be shot-\nSo you must be content with the original; which, on a fine evening in Montreuil, you will see as you change horses: but unless you have as bad a reason for haste as I have, you had better stop-\n- Lord help me! I could not.",
