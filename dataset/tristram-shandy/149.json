Sufficiently, replied my father.\nIn saying this, my father shut the book, --not as if he resolved to read no more of it, for he kept his forefinger in the chapter: ----nor pettishly, --for he shut the book slowly; his thumb resting, when he had done it, upon the upper-side of the cover, as his three fingers supported the lower side of it, without the least compressive violence.----\nI have demonstrated the truth of that point, quoth my father, nodding to _Yorick_, most sufficiently in the preceding chapter.\nNow could the man in the moon be told, that a man in the earth had wrote a chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That the secret of all health depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the _radical heat_ and the _radical moisture_, --and that he had managed the point so well, that there was not one single word wet or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture, throughout the whole chapter, --or a single syllable in it, _pro_ or _con_, directly or indirectly, upon the contention betwixt these two powers in any part of the animal conomy----\n\"O thou eternal Maker of all beings!\" --he would cry, striking his breast with his right hand (in case he had one)-- \"Thou whose power and goodness can enlarge the faculties of thy creatures to this infinite degree of excellence and perfection, --What have we MOONITES done?\"",
