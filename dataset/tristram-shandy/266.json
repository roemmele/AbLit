And\nI see him yonder with his pipe pendulous in his hand, and the ashes falling out of it--looking--and looking--then rubbing his eyes--and looking again, with twice the good-nature that ever _Gallileo_ look'd for a spot in the sun.\n----In vain! for by all the powers which animate the organ ----Widow _Wadman's_ left eye shines this moment as lucid as her right----there is neither mote, or sand, or dust, or chaff, or speck, or particle of opake matter floating in it --There is nothing, my dear paternal uncle! but one lambent delicious fire, furtively shooting out from every part of it, in all directions, into thine----\n----If thou lookest, uncle _Toby_, in search of this mote one moment longer----thou art undone.\n[Footnote 8.4: _Rodope Thracia_ tam inevitabili fascino instructa, tam exact oculus intuens attraxit, ut si in illam quis incidisset, fieri non posset, quin caperetur. ----I know not who.]",

'A mote - or sand - or something - has got into my eye - do look into it.'\nIn saying which, Mrs. Wadman edged herself close in beside my uncle Toby, and squeezed herself upon the corner of his bench. 'Do look into it,' said she.\nHonest soul! thou didst look into it with as much innocence as a child; and 'twere as much a sin to have hurt thee.\nI will answer for my uncle Toby, that he would have sat quietly upon a sofa from June to January, with an eye as fine as the Thracian Rodope's beside him, without being able to tell whether it was black or blue.\nThe difficulty was to get my uncle Toby to look at an eye at all.\n'Tis surmounted. And\nI see him with his pipe in his hand, and the ashes falling out of it - looking and looking again, with twice the good-nature that ever Galileo looked for a spot in the sun.\nIn vain! for Widow Wadman's left eye shines as lucid as her right - there is neither mote, or sand, or dust, or speck floating in it. - Nothing, my dear uncle! but one delicious fire, furtively shooting out from it, into thine-\nIf thou lookest, uncle Toby, one moment longer - thou art undone.",
