        "text": "When Dr. _Slop_ entered the back parlour, where my father and my uncle _Toby_ were discoursing upon the nature of women, ----it was hard to determine whether Dr. _Slop's_ figure, or Dr. _Slop's_ presence, occasioned more surprize to them; for as the accident happened so near the house, as not to make it worth while for _Obadiah_ to remount him, ----Obadiah had led him in as he was, _unwiped_, _unappointed_, _unannealed_, with all his stains and blotches on him. --He stood like _Hamlet's_ ghost, motionless and speechless, for a full minute and a half at the parlour-door (_Obadiah_ still holding his hand) with all the majesty of mud. His hinder parts, upon which he had received his fall, totally besmeared, ----and in every other part of him, blotched over in such a manner with _Obadiah's_ explosion, that you would have sworn (without mental reservation) that every grain of it had taken effect.\nHere was a fair opportunity for my uncle _Toby_ to have triumphed over my father in his turn; --for no mortal, who had beheld Dr. _Slop_ in that pickle, could have dissented from so much at least, of my uncle _Toby's_ opinion, \"That mayhap his sister might not care to let such a Dr. _Slop_ come so near her ****.\" But it was the _Argumentum ad hominem_; and if my uncle _Toby_ was not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care to use it. ----No; the reason was, --'twas not his nature to insult.\nDr. _Slop's_ presence at that time, was no less problematical than the mode of it; tho' it is certain, one moment's reflexion in my father might have solved it; for he had apprized Dr. _Slop_ but the week before, that my mother was at her full reckoning; and as the doctor had heard nothing since, 'twas natural and very political too in him, to have taken a ride to _Shandy-Hall_, as he did, merely to see how matters went on.\nBut my father's mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the investigation; running, like the hypercritick's, altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door, --measuring their distance, and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation as to have power to think of nothing else, ----common-place infirmity of the greatest mathematicians! working with might and main at the demonstration, and so wasting all their strength upon it, that they have none left in them to draw the corollary, to do good with.\nThe ringing of the bell, and the rap upon the door, struck likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle _Toby_, --but it excited a very different train of thoughts; --the two irreconcileable pulsations instantly brought _Stevinus_, the great engineer, along with them, into my uncle _Toby's_ mind. What business _Stevinus_ had in this affair, --is the greatest problem of all: ----It shall be solved, --but not in the next chapter.",

        "text": "When Dr. Slop entered the back parlour, where my father and my uncle Toby were discussing the nature of women, it was hard to say whether Dr. Slop's appearance, or his presence, surprised them more; for Obadiah had led him in as he was, unwiped, with all his stains and blotches on him.\nHe stood like Hamlet's ghost, motionless and speechless, for a full minute and a half at the parlour-door in all the majesty of mud. His hinder parts, upon which he had fallen, were totally besmeared, and every other part so blotched with Obadiah's explosion, that you would have sworn that every grain of it had taken effect.\nHere was an opportunity for my uncle Toby to have triumphed over my father; for no one who beheld Dr. Slop in that pickle, could disagree with my uncle's opinion, 'That mayhap Mrs. Shandy might not care to let Dr. Slop come near her ****.' But 'twas not my uncle Toby's nature to insult.\nHad my father reflected a moment, he might have recalled that he had told Dr. Slop only the week before, that my mother was at her full reckoning; and 'twas very natural in the doctor to have ridden to Shandy-Hall, to see how matters went on.\nBut my father's mind took unfortunately a wrong turn; running upon his ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door, measuring the distance betwixt them, and able to think of nothing else.\nThe ringing of the bell, and the rap upon the door, likewise struck my uncle Toby, - but it excited a very different train of thought; - the noises instantly brought Stevinus, the great engineer, into my uncle Toby's mind. What business Stevinus had in this affair, is the greatest problem of all. - It shall be solved, but not in the next chapter.",
