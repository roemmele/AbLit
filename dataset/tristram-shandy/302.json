And here without staying for my reply, shall I be called as many blockheads, numsculs, doddypoles, dunderheads, ninny-hammers, goosecaps, joltheads, nincompoops, and sh- -t-a-beds---- and other unsavoury appellations, as ever the cake-bakers of _Lern_ cast in the teeth of King _Garangantan's_ shepherds ----And I'll let them do it, as _Bridget_ said, as much as they please; for how was it possible they should foresee the necessity I was under of writing the 25th chapter of my book, before the 18th, &c.?\n------So I don't take it amiss ----All I wish is, that it may be a lesson to the world, \"_to let people tell their stories their own way_.\"",
