Mrs. Wadman has left a ball here,' quoth my uncle Toby, pointing to his breast.\n'She can no more withstand a siege, than she can fly,' cried the corporal.\n'But as we are neighbours, Trim, I think it best to let her know it civilly first,' quoth my uncle Toby.\n'If I might presume to differ from your honour - I would begin with making a good thundering attack upon her, in return - and telling her civilly afterwards. For if she knows anything of your honour's being in love, beforehand-'\n'L__d help her! she knows no more of it,' said my uncle Toby, 'than the child unborn.'\nPrecious souls!\nMrs. Wadman had told it, with all its circumstances, to Bridget twenty-four hours before; and was at that very moment consulting her about some slight misgivings which the Devil, who never lies dead in a ditch, had put into her head.\n'I am terribly afraid,' said widow Wadman, 'that if I should marry him, Bridget, the poor captain will not enjoy good health, with the monstrous wound upon his groin.'\n'It may not be so very large,' replied Bridget, 'as you think, Madam. I believe, besides, that 'tis dried up.'\n'I would like to know - merely for his sake,' said Mrs. Wadman.\n'We'll know the long and the broad of it in ten days,' answered Bridget; 'for whilst the captain is paying his addresses to you, I'm confident Mr. Trim will be for making love to me - and I'll let him, to get it all out of him.'\nThese measures were taken. Meanwhile, my uncle Toby and the corporal went on with theirs.\n'Now,' quoth the corporal, one arm a-kimbo, 'if your honour will give me leave to lay down the plan of this attack-'\n'That will please me exceedingly,' said my uncle Toby, 'and as thou must act as my aid de camp, here's a crown for thy commission.'\n'Then, your honour,' said the corporal, making a bow, 'we will begin with getting your honour's laced clothes out of the campaign-trunk, and have the blue and gold taken up at the sleeves - and I'll put your white wig fresh into pipes - and send for a tailor, to have your honour's thin scarlet breeches turned-'\n'I had better take the red plush ones,' quoth my uncle Toby.\n'They will be too clumsy,' said the corporal.",
