Then I change my shirt - put on a better coat - send for my latest wig - put my topaz ring upon my finger; and in a word, dress myself, from one end to the other, after my best fashion.\nNow the devil must be in it, if this does not do: for consider, Sir, as every man is present at the shaving of his own beard - the Situation puts her own notion into the brain.\n- I maintain that the ideas of a rough-bearded man are seven years more terse for one single shave; and if they did not risk being quite shaved away, might be carried up by continual shavings to the highest pitch of sublimity. How Homer could write with so long a beard, I don't know - and as it defies my hypothesis, I don't care. - But let us return to the dress.\nLudovicus Sorbonensis makes this entirely an affair of the body; but he is deceived: the soul and body are joint-sharers in everything they get. A man cannot dress without his ideas getting clothed at the same time; and if he dresses like a gentleman, every one of them stands presented to his imagination, genteelized along with him - so that he has nothing to do, but take his pen, and write like himself.\nAnd so, when your honours would know whether I wrote clean and fit to be read, you will be able to judge full as well by looking into my Laundress's bill, as my book. There was one single month in which I dirtied thirty shirts with clean writing; and yet was more abused, cursed, and criticised for what I had wrote in that one month, than in all the other months of that year put together.\n-But my critics had not seen my bills.",
