        "text": "It was to my uncle Toby's eternal honour, that although he was warmly engaged at that time in carrying on the siege of Dendermond, and had already made a lodgment upon the counterscarp, nevertheless he gave it up, and bent his whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn; and except that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up, by which he might be said to have turned the siege into a blockade, he left Dendermond to itself; and only considered how to relieve the poor lieutenant and his son.\nThat kind being, who is a friend to the friendless, shall recompense thee for this.\nAs corporal Trim was putting him to bed, my uncle Toby said, 'I tell thee, Trim: when thou offered'st my services to Le Fever - as sickness and travelling are expensive for a poor lieutenant, with a son to support - thou shouldst have made an offer to him of my purse; he would have been welcome to it.'\n'Your honour gave me no orders,' said the corporal.\n'True,' quoth my uncle; 'thou didst very right, Trim, as a soldier, but very wrong as a man. And when thou offered'st him whatever was in my house, thou shouldst have offered him my house too. A sick brother officer should have the best quarters, Trim, and we could tend and look to him. Thou art an excellent nurse, Trim, and with thy care, and the old woman's, and his boy's, and mine together, we might set him upon his legs: in a fortnight or three weeks, he might march.'\n'He will never march, your honour, in this world,' said the corporal.\n'He will march,' said my uncle Toby, rising up, with one shoe off.\n'An' please your honour,' said the corporal, 'he will never march but to his grave.'\n'He shall march,' cried my uncle Toby, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without advancing an inch; 'he shall march to his regiment.'\n'He cannot stand,' said the corporal.\n'He shall be supported,' said my uncle Toby.\n'He'll drop,' said the corporal, 'and what will become of his boy? do what we can for him, the poor soul will die.'\n'He shall not die, by G__,' cried my uncle Toby.\n- The Accusing Spirit, which flew up to heaven with the oath, blushed as he gave it in; and the Recording Angel, as he wrote it down, dropped a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.",
